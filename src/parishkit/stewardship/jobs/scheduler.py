"""One connection-pinned scheduler, with broker publication outside transactions.

The admitted runtime keeps this dedicated database connection for its lifetime;
it must not use the installer's close-after-each-pass loop. Losing the connection
requires exiting/reacquiring ownership, never silently continuing after reconnect.
Duplicate transport hints remain harmless even across a connection-loss race.
