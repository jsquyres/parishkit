"""Fresh transactional campaign gates for compiled-in owning task handlers.

These functions are not user authorization, domain-completion proof or a generic
maintenance bypass. A handler loads its immutable campaign/mode/epoch binding
from its own durable request, then checks here at creation, claim and each effect.
Restore/purge/cleanup/operational exception handlers require their owning later
workflows; no caller-supplied boolean or queue name can enable an exemption.
