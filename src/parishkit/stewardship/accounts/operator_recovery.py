"""Internal offline recovery protocol; no web or queue exposure.

Operational commands supply a real offline/startup interlock and explicit
operator confirmation. The required trusted context manager must
verify that all online services are stopped and prevent concurrent startup for
its full duration. A plain UUID, boolean or ordinary Admin identity is not that
authority. Unit/database tests may supply a synthetic interlock over disposable
storage; composed operator tests exercise the actual kernel lease.
