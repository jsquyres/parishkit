# ParishSoft API Analysis: v1 vs. v2

This document compares the two ParishSoft REST API generations that a parish
deployment may encounter, records which one ParishKit uses and why, and analyzes
whether ParishKit should switch APIs, run a hybrid, or adopt currently-unused
capabilities (including the write endpoints both APIs now expose).

It is a companion to the [top-level ParishKit spec](specs/intro/spec.md) and is
referenced by every tool that reads ParishSoft data:
[`pk-sync-ps-to-cc`](specs/pk-sync-ps-to-cc/spec.md),
[`pk-sync-ps-to-ggroup`](specs/pk-sync-ps-to-ggroup/spec.md),
[`pk-create-ps-ministry-rosters`](specs/pk-create-ps-ministry-rosters/spec.md),
[`pk-query-ps-memfam`](specs/pk-query-ps-memfam/spec.md), and
[`pk-print-ps-ministries`](specs/pk-print-ps-ministries/spec.md).

The package-level data layer that consumes whichever API is selected lives in
`src/parishkit/parishsoft.py`; its runtime wiring is `parishsoft_runtime.py`.
See the [intro spec's ParishSoft data layer section](specs/intro/spec.md#parishsoft-data-layer)
for how that code is structured.

## 1. Identities: two generations, not two copies

The two hosts are **two API generations of the same ParishSoft Family Suite
database**, not diverged forks of one API. They expose nearly identical record
data under different URL shapes, naming conventions, and authentication models.

| Property | **API v2 (ParishKit uses this)** | **API v1 (the "other" API)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | `ps-fs-external-api-prod.azurewebsites.net` | `fsapi.parishsoft.app` |
| Swagger UI | `…/index.html` | `…/index.html` |
| Raw spec | `…/swagger/v2/swagger.json` | `…/swagger/v1/swagger.json` |
| Spec title | **ParishSoft Family Suite 2.0** | **ParishSoft Customer API v1** |
| Base path | `/api/v2` | `/api` |
| Path style | lowercase, REST-ish (`families/search`, `members/{id}/contact`) | PascalCase, RPC-ish (`Families/UpdateFamilyContactInfo`) |
| Path count | 34 | 56 |
| Schema count | 41 | 44 |
| Pagination | Envelope with `pagingInfo` (`*ListPagingResponse`) | Mostly bare JSON lists |
| **Authentication** | **`x-api-key` request header** (no login endpoint) | **`POST /api/Login` + `/api/Token/Authenticate`** (username/password → token) |
| Write verb shape | `PUT` with the record id in the URL | `POST` with the record id in the body |

ParishKit targets **v2**. The default base URL is
`https://ps-fs-external-api-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/v2`
(`DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL` in `parishsoft.py`), and the client authenticates with
the `x-api-key` header read from a credential file at runtime.

**The authentication difference is the single most important practical fact.**
v2 needs only a parish-provisioned API key; v1 requires storing and rotating
parish login credentials and minting tokens. Any move toward v1 conflicts with
ParishKit's credential posture (API-key files on disk, no stored passwords).

## 2. Venn diagram — endpoint coverage

### 2.1 Shared by BOTH (same capability, different spelling)

- **Constituents** — search + detail.
- **Families** — search, detail, member list, ministry list, group lookup,
  workgroup list + per-workgroup roster, family-changes (incremental) feed,
  **contact-info update (write)**, **autofill update (write)**.
- **Members** — search, detail, sacrament list, status lookup, type lookup,
  workgroup lookups + per-workgroup roster, contact-info list,
  **contact-info update (write)**.
- **Ministry** — type list, minister roster (read only).
- **Offering** — funds, givers, family contribution summary.
- **Organizations** — search / detail.
- **QuickSearch** — families / members.
- A health/test ping endpoint.

### 2.2 Unique to v2 (ParishKit's API) — *absent in v1*

- `offering/pledge/list` — **full pledge listing**.
- `offering/contributiondetail/list` — **per-contribution detail listing**.
- Org-wide `offering/{organizationId}/givers`.
- `families/quick-search` / `members/quick-search` as first-class POST endpoints.
- Structured pagination envelope (`PagingInfo`) across all list endpoints.
- `MemberSearchResponseDto` adds `fatherName`, `motherName`,
  `responsibleAdultName`.

> **ParishKit depends on two of these v2-only endpoints**:
> `offering/pledge/list` and `offering/contributiondetail/list`
> (`load_pledges` / `load_contribution_details` in `parishsoft.py`). v1 has no
> equivalent — it offers only a per-family contribution *summary*. This alone
> rules out a wholesale switch to v1 without regressing giving features.

### 2.3 Unique to v1 (the "other" API) — *absent in v2*

- **MinistryScheduler** + `MinistryScheduler/MinistryRecords/{ID}` — liturgical
  / volunteer scheduling.
- **ReligiousEducation** — `Classes/{ID}`, `MemberAttendanceSummary/{ID}`.
- **Sacrament register reports** — Baptism, Confirmation, First Eucharist,
  Funeral, Matrimony, RCIA dynamic filter, Kenedy statistics summary, plus a
  generic `Sacraments` endpoint.
- **LifeEvent** feed.
- **Staff** — `/api/Staff`, `QuickSearch/Staff/List/Organization/{ID}/Active`.
- **Member SecureFields** — `GET SecureFields/{ID}` **and**
  `POST UpdateMemberSecureFields` (10 parish-defined encrypted fields + notes).
- Richer QuickSearch — organizations by name, org/member lookups.
- Per-family givers — `Offering/{ID}/Givers/{FamilyDUID}` (v2's givers endpoint
  is org-wide only).

### 2.4 Data fields are near-identical where they overlap

The underlying record shapes are the same database, just renamed:

| Record | v2 schema | v1 schema | Shared fields | v2-only | v1-only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member (search) | `MemberSearchResponseDto` | `MemberResultModel` | 59 | `fatherName`, `motherName`, `responsibleAdultName` | (none) |
| Member contact | `MemberContactListResponseDto` | `MemberContactInfoResultModel` | 16 | (none) | (none) |
| Family (search) | `FamilySearchResponseDto` | `FamilyResultModel` | 40 | (none) | `webLinkDescription` |
| Family member | `FamilyMemberResponseDto` | `FamilyMemberResultModel` | 44 | (none) | `ssn` |
| Sacrament | `SacramentDto` | `SacrementModel` | 42 | (none) | (none) |
| Giver | `GiverListResponseDto` | `FundGiverModel` | 13 | (none) | (none) |

The one real divergence is the **ministry roster**: v1 uses `*DUID`/`*ID`
naming (`ministryTypeDUID`, `ministryRoleDUID`, `eventTypeDUID`, `familyDUID`),
while v2 uses `*Id` naming plus `trained`, `subOnly`, `emailAddress`, and
explicit `startDate`/`endDate`. Same concept, incompatible field names — code
written against one cannot read the other's roster rows without a translation
layer. ParishKit's `parishsoft.py` already tolerates several of these
`DUID`/`Id` naming inconsistencies via `_copy_first_duid`.

## 3. The "read-only" axiom is obsolete — but only narrowly

ParishKit's README and `parishsoft.py` historically state the ParishSoft API is
read-only. **Both APIs now expose write endpoints**, so the axiom should be
restated precisely:

> The ParishSoft APIs are read-only **except** for member/family
> contact-information fields (and, in v1 only, member secure custom fields).
> Census structure, ministry rosters, workgroup membership, giving, and
> sacraments remain read-only.

### 3.1 Families — writable in BOTH

**Contact update** (v2 `PUT families/{familyId}/contact` ≡ v1
`POST UpdateFamilyContactInfo`) — identical 36-field payload (v1 also carries
`familyDUID` in the body since the id is not in the URL):

- Names/salutations: `firstName`, `lastName`, `mailingName`,
  `informalMailingName`, `formalSalutation`, `informalSalutation`.
- Contact: `emailAddress`, `primaryPhone`, `emergencyPhone`, `primaryAddress`.
- Three full address blocks — **home / mailing / other** — each with
  `…AddressLine1`, `…AddressLine2`, `…City`, `…State`, `…Country`,
  `…PostalCode`, `…PostalCodePlus4`, `…AddressPhone`; the "other" block adds
  `otherAddressFromDate` / `otherAddressToDate`.
- `sdiocesanId`.

**Autofill update** (v2 `PUT families/{familyId}/autofill` ≡ v1
`UpdateFamilyAutoFill`) — takes only `organizationID`. This triggers
ParishSoft's server-side recomputation of the family's formal/informal mailing
names and salutations from its members (a "regenerate derived fields" action,
not a field write).

### 3.2 Members — contact writable in BOTH; SecureFields write only in v1

**Contact update** (v2 `PUT members/{memberId}/contact` ≡ v1
`POST UpdateMemberContactInfo`) — 15-field payload (v1 also carries `memberDUID`
and `familyDUID` in the body):

- Names: `firstName`, `nickName`, `middleName`, `lastName`, `maidenName`.
- Dates: `dateOfBirth`, `dateOfDeath`.
- `language`, `gender`.
- Contact: `emailAddress`, `homePhone`, `cellPhone`, `workPhone`, `pager`,
  `fax`.

**Secure fields** — **v1 only**: `POST UpdateMemberSecureFields` writes
`field1`–`field10` + `notes` (10 parish-defined encrypted custom fields). v2 has
no SecureFields endpoint at all.

### 3.3 Ministry & Workgroup records — READ-ONLY in BOTH

Neither API can write ministry data. There is **no** endpoint in either API to:

- create / edit / delete a ministry type;
- add or remove a minister from a roster;
- change a minister's role, training flag, or start/end dates;
- assign or unassign members/families to workgroups.

This directly constrains ParishKit's roster tooling
([`pk-create-ps-ministry-rosters`](specs/pk-create-ps-ministry-rosters/spec.md)): it
can **plan and report** roster state but cannot push roster changes back into
ParishSoft through either API. Roster mutation still requires the ParishSoft UI.

## 4. What ParishKit uses today vs. what is available

ParishKit currently issues only reads and read-style search POSTs, all against
v2 (see `parishsoft.py` loaders):

`organizations/search`, `families/search`, `members/search`,
`families/group/lookup/list`, `families/workgroup/list` + `/{id}/list`,
`members/contact/list`, `members/workgroup/lookup/list` + `/{id}/list`,
`ministry/type/list`, `ministry/{id}/minister/list`,
`offering/{org}/funds`, `offering/pledge/list`,
`offering/contributiondetail/list`.

Additional v2 capabilities, in priority order:

1. **`families/change/list` (FamilyChanges)** — an incremental "what changed
   since X" feed. ParishKit currently pages the entire census on every run; this
   can provide delta indications. The shared `parishsoft_changes` adapter now
   exposes validated, uncached Family identities; the operational Stewardship
   refresh workflow remains in progress.
2. **`PUT members/{id}/contact` + `PUT families/{id}/contact`** — would let
   ParishKit *write back* corrected emails/phones/addresses instead of only
   reporting discrepancies. The package client already anticipates this:
   `ParishSoftClient.post_uncached` exists "for future mutation-style API calls"
   (a v2 write would add a `put`/`put_uncached` sibling, since v2 writes are
   `PUT` with the id in the URL).
3. **`members/{id}/sacrament/{type}/list`** — sacramental data for any future
   reporting need.
4. **`offering/{org}/contribution/summary/list`** — pre-aggregated giving
   summaries, cheaper than paging full contribution detail when only totals are
   needed.

## 5. Recommendation

**Stay on v2 as the primary API. Do not switch wholesale. Treat a hybrid as a
last resort gated on a v1-exclusive requirement.**

### 5.1 Do not switch wholesale to v1

- v1 lacks `offering/pledge/list` and `offering/contributiondetail/list`, which
  ParishKit depends on (summaries only) — switching regresses giving features.
- v1 requires username/password login + token auth versus v2's single API key;
  heavier, less deployment-friendly, and at odds with ParishKit's secrets model.
- v1 has no pagination envelope (ParishKit's `_extract_page` handles both
  shapes, but v2's contract is cleaner).
- v1's only net-new *data* is `ssn`, `webLinkDescription`, and differently-named
  ministry roster fields — not worth a migration.

### 5.2 Stay on v2 and adopt its unused capabilities

v2 is the modern, actively-named ("Family Suite 2.0"), API-key-authenticated,
paginated generation, and is effectively a superset of v1 for everything
ParishKit needs. The near-term wins live entirely within v2: add
`families/change/list` for incremental sync, and (optionally) enable
contact write-back through new `PUT` helpers.

### 5.3 Consider a narrow hybrid only if a v1-exclusive feature is required

v1 is the *only* source for SecureFields read/write, MinistryScheduler,
ReligiousEducation, sacrament register reports, Staff lists, and LifeEvent. If
one of those becomes a hard requirement, add a *secondary* v1 client (its own
base URL and its own login-token auth path) used solely for those endpoints,
while v2 remains the primary census/giving/workgroup source. `ParishSoftConfig`
is parameterized by `api_base_url`, so a second client instance is feasible —
but it needs a distinct authentication mechanism, so treat it as real work, not
a config toggle.

### 5.4 If write-back is pursued

Start with **member/family contact updates** (identical in both APIs, low risk,
high value for closing the "we detected a bad email" loop). Do **not** plan on
ministry-roster write-back — neither API supports it. Any write path must honor
ParishKit's dry-run discipline (see
[intro spec, dry-run and write safety](specs/intro/spec.md#dry-run-and-write-safety))
and the `expected_organization` guard before mutating a tenant.

## 6. Reproducing this analysis

The September 11, 2026 contract check against the
[published v2 OpenAPI document](https://ps-fs-external-api-prod.azurewebsites.net/swagger/v2/swagger.json)
confirmed `FamilyChangeList` is an unpaginated GET with required date-only
`StartDate` and `EndDate`, returning `family_DUID`, `logDate` and organization
fields alongside private contact detail. It has no server cursor or upper-event
watermark. The shared adapter returns only distinct sorted Family IDs, checks
the tenant uncached, and requires full refresh for malformed/oversized responses,
unscoped organization changes or ambiguous timestamps. Consumers must overlap
date windows and commit their own poll boundary only after successful atomic
reconciliation. This feed does not replace full Member/Ministry/giving refresh.

The findings above were derived from the published OpenAPI specs:

```sh
curl -fsS https://ps-fs-external-api-prod.azurewebsites.net/swagger/v2/swagger.json
curl -fsS https://fsapi.parishsoft.app/swagger/v1/swagger.json
```

The raw spec JSON is generated/third-party data and is intentionally **not**
committed to this repository (see the no-generated-artifacts rule in the
[intro spec](specs/intro/spec.md#development-guidelines)). Re-fetch and diff the
`paths`, `components.schemas`, and per-endpoint `requestBody` blocks to refresh
this comparison when ParishSoft revises either API.
