# Stewardship PostgreSQL tests

These tests implement the [data plan's migration policy](../plans/stewardship/data.md#migration-policy).
They run only against a disposable PostgreSQL server, not parish data or a
production deployment. They use the same pinned PostgreSQL image as Compose;
no provider credentials, existing volumes, or host data mounts are used.

The ordinary `python -m pytest` baseline still uses Django's dummy database
backend and reports the database tests as explicit skips. The separate
`stewardship-postgresql` CI job must pass; a skipped baseline is not PostgreSQL
verification. Do not substitute SQLite for constraint or concurrency evidence.

The coverage gate runs the baseline and then the required PostgreSQL suite into
one fresh coverage database, measuring the same complete scope and separate 80%
line/branch floors. After starting both disposable services below, run:

```sh
python -m parishkit.stewardship.quality --postgresql \
  --report /tmp/stewardship-combined-coverage.json
```

Choose a new report path each time; existing files are never overwritten. Without
`--postgresql`, the runner measures only baseline coverage and may fail the floors
as database-backed functionality grows. CI's PostgreSQL job owns the combined
coverage gate; the baseline and Compose jobs retain their independent tests.

## Parallel CI and live progress

Pull-request CI runs eight deterministic PostgreSQL partitions on eight separate
runners, each with its own PostgreSQL/Valkey cluster. Only partition one also runs
the credential-free baseline into its raw coverage database. The required
`stewardship-postgresql` check independently collects the full database test
universe, requires successful receipts for all eight exact partitions from the
same source tree, and combines raw line/branch data before enforcing both 80%
floors. Missing, failed, skipped, cancelled or stale partition evidence cannot
pass. Coverage percentages are never averaged across partitions.

Partitions are cost-balanced, not equal-count hash buckets. The scheduler assigns
known slow lease/drain and population tests first, then fills the least-loaded
runner; shard one reserves time for baseline coverage. Rounded scheduling hints
come from CI run `34754804591`. New tests always receive a default cost and are
included. Hints change placement only, never deadlines, assertions or membership.
Independent collection and exact execution receipts remain authoritative.

That run passed all checks: PostgreSQL including aggregation completed in
11 minutes 32 seconds, whereas Compose took 18 minutes 52 seconds. The latter
was the overall bottleneck, including 15 minutes 28 seconds of serial operational
tests. CI now puts each of the eight operational scenarios on its own runner.
The original `stewardship-compose` required check joins both the core container
checks and the entire operational matrix, failing on any failure or cancellation.
No shared database, container name, network or test volume crosses those runners.

Each database test emits UTC `CI_PROGRESS` START and END records, including
elapsed time after teardown. The last START without an END identifies the active
test, including a blocked fixture. A test exceeding 120 seconds prints a Python
stack trace without local variables; this is a diagnostic, not a passing result.
Each shard's test subprocesses share one 20-minute deadline; each job has a 25-minute
limit, and aggregation has a 10-minute limit. Slowest-test summaries are retained
in job logs. A deadline fails the gate rather than silently skipping work.

The serial command above remains the equivalent developer/release coverage
gate. To see live progress on a focused local database run, add `--ci-progress`
and `--durations=20` to pytest. Do not run multiple shards against the same local
cluster: tests use cluster-wide roles and a shared disposable test database.
The CI matrix isolates those resources rather than relying on concurrent pytest
workers sharing them.

Fresh schema creation now uses the
[unreleased baseline](stewardship-schema.md), not historical development
upgrade/downgrade cycles. Current constraint, authorization and concurrency
tests remain mandatory.

## Local disposable server

Use an unused container name and loopback port. If the chosen name or port is
already occupied, investigate it; do not delete or stop an unrelated container.
This command creates only temporary test data in container tmpfs:

```sh
docker run --detach --name parishkit-storage-tests \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:55432:5432 \
  --env POSTGRES_USER=stewardship_tests \
  --env POSTGRES_DB=stewardship_tests \
  --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=disposable-test-only \
  --tmpfs /var/lib/postgresql \
  postgres:18.6-trixie@sha256:4ef4dbc939d61acea57712655ddb4b4ab27419c913f94cca0cd57cb3ea3c2280
docker exec parishkit-storage-tests pg_isready -U stewardship_tests
```

Wait until `pg_isready` reports accepting connections before running tests.
The documented password is synthetic, intentionally public, and used only for
this disposable loopback server. Never reuse it in a deployment.

Authentication tests also require the pinned disposable Valkey service used by
CI. Its fixture port is fixed at `127.0.0.1:56379`; do not substitute a real
deployment or stop an unrelated service already using that port.

```sh
docker run --detach --name parishkit-auth-tests \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:56379:6379 --tmpfs /data \
  valkey/valkey:9.1.2@sha256:c123e3715db63d06d4ad6964884037aa0d5d4d703939b9929954112889708e1d
docker exec parishkit-auth-tests valkey-cli ping
```

Wait for `PONG`. Missing Valkey fails authentication verification rather than
skipping it. No real provider credentials are required.

```sh
python -m pytest tests/stewardship/database \
  --ds=parishkit.stewardship.settings.database_test --require-postgresql-tests -q
python -m django makemigrations --check --dry-run \
  --settings=parishkit.stewardship.settings.database_test
```

For a different host port, set `PARISHKIT_TEST_POSTGRES_PORT` consistently with
the Docker port mapping. The profile fixes the host to loopback and database/
role names to `stewardship_tests`. Pytest creates and drops
`test_stewardship_tests`; do not put retained data in either database. Do not
override database settings to target a real deployment.

After testing, stop and remove only the disposable container you created:

```sh
docker stop parishkit-storage-tests
docker rm parishkit-storage-tests
docker stop parishkit-auth-tests
docker rm parishkit-auth-tests
```

Stopping the container discards its synthetic tmpfs data. There is no retained
data to recover; the next run rebuilds the schema from migrations.

## Foundation boundaries

The initial records establish storage contracts, not usable authentication.
The AuditEvent envelope belongs to the deployment's one parish independently
of any campaign. Soft actor/subject UUIDs preserve attribution after session
cleanup and future campaign purge; they are not authorization references.
Business-owned relationships use explicit protected foreign keys. The audit
table's UPDATE/DELETE trigger complements ORM immutability; runtime roles must
not have TRUNCATE or schema-owner privileges, which OPS-02/OPS-04 implement
before production is enabled. Migration/test owners intentionally can reset a
disposable schema.

`mutate_record` holds a row lock and checks an expected version. Its callback
must check the owning workflow's current authorization and admission inside
that transaction. It is an internal storage primitive, not an authorization
API. Do not make external calls inside callbacks. Session expiry/revocation,
event-specific payload validation, configuration activation, and task claims
retain their existing package owners and are not enabled by these primitives.

New concrete MutableRecord tables must install the frozen `mutable_guard_v1`
migration builder (with any additional immutable binding columns). A PostgreSQL
test checks that every concrete subclass has its enabled row-level guard.
It also compares model-declared immutable/write-once columns with the installed
SQL predicates, so changing only the Python declaration fails verification.
ImmutableRecord tables use `immutable_guard_v1`; a companion all-model test
requires their BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE row guard. Both SQL guard families raise
an integrity violation, independent of the ORM's StorageInvariantError.
Each table owns its generated function/trigger lifetime, so reversing one model
does not remove another model's protection. Change future guard semantics via a
new version and an explicit migration. Existing-row creation/write timestamps
are not rewritten; new default timestamps come from PostgreSQL's statement clock.
Explicit historical timestamps remain possible for controlled import/migration
code. The optimistic counter, not wall-clock monotonicity, orders mutations.

Every mutable session UPDATE must advance `version` by exactly one; a database
trigger rejects writes that leave the optimistic token unchanged and stamps
`updated_at` from PostgreSQL. Prefer `mutate_record`, which also checks the
caller's expected version and returns the refreshed write time. Initial record
correlation defaults reuse the current request/task scope; unscoped creation
starts a new correlation. Datetime fields accept aware datetime objects and
explicit-offset ISO strings, but never infer missing timezones.

The mutation helper binds its supplied correlation while running the callback,
so dependent audit records use the same operation ID even without an outer
request scope. It restores any outer scope on success and failure. Forbidden
history/identity mutations raise StorageInvariantError, not user-field
ValidationError. PortalSession's principal, session key, and authentication
instant are immutable bindings; a new login creates a new attribution record.
Once revoked_at is recorded, neither the helper nor a version-advancing SQL
update may clear or change it. A later authorization grant needs a new login,
not restoration of an old session's validity.

Do not schedule Django's standalone `clearsessions` against protected
PortalSession rows: one protected expired session aborts that entire sweep.
ARC-04 must install an ordered metadata/session cleanup service before enabling
authentication. A database regression documents this prerequisite; it is not
an implementation of the identity cleanup policy.
