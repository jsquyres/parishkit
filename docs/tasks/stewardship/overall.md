# Stewardship top-level task execution plan

Start here to coordinate all eight [subsystem task lists](README.md). This is
the task-level navigation companion to the
[controlling implementation plan](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md), which
owns dependency ordering, allowed phase scope, and gate exit requirements.
Use [milestones](milestones.md) for demonstration and review status.

Standing scope override: follow the
[pre-production development policy](../../specs/stewardship/operations/spec.md#pre-production-development-policy)
for all remaining work. Historical upgrade/downgrade implementation and tests
are not dependency-ready requirements until production-readiness work is
explicitly activated; older evidence describes what was tested then, not work
to recreate after baseline consolidation.

## How to select the next work

1. Find the earliest incomplete phase whose preceding review gate has passed and
   whose preceding phase PR has merged. Follow the controlling plan's
   [automated phase delivery cycle](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#automated-phase-delivery-cycle)
   for branch creation, delegated decisions, review rounds, CI, and standing merge authority.
2. Follow the ordered package links below; within a package, inspect its full
   plan item, task evidence, and dependencies before selecting work.
3. Deliver a coherent subphase/vertical slice, verify it, and update its owning task lists.
   Record partial scope when a package spans phases; do not mark a whole package
   done because its first consumer works. Continue through dependency-ready tasks
   within the batch without routine approval stops. Individual storage records,
   migrations and helpers are internal checkpoints, not default PR boundaries.
4. Complete the phase demonstration and required review/fix rounds, then create
   or update its PR and correct CI failures. At a formal gate, also validate and
   review the complete integrated gate scope. Follow the controlling cycle's
   standing merge authority and remaining explicit approval boundaries; wait for
   the merge to land on `origin/main` before branching the next increment.
5. On handoff, record active phase, completed task IDs, implementation SHA,
   validation evidence, remaining scope, and the next dependency-ready task.

The sequences below reference packages; a suffix such as `DOM-02.01` identifies
one task. Ranges mean every intervening package in the linked subsystem file.
M0 through M7 and G1 through G5 are evidence checklists in [milestones](milestones.md),
not duplicate implementation tasks. Each phase heading links to its complete
source scope so exceptions and demonstrations are not redefined here.

## Phase 0: Skeleton

Source scope: [Phase 0: Skeleton](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-0-reproducible-project-skeleton).

Execution checkpoint (September 8, 2026): the human approved the ARC-02 phase
split now recorded in the controlling plan. See its
[partial completion evidence](architecture.md#arc-02-shared-cli-configuration-paths-and-app-startup).
ARC-01 and DOM-01 evidence is recorded in their owning checklists. The
[OPS-01 scaffold](operations.md#ops-01-development-and-production-compose-topology)
now passes local Compose demonstrations and host/image baseline parity. Reserved
services still refuse startup pending their owning implementation packages.
Phase 0 [OPS-09 CI/coverage](operations.md#ops-09-ci-coverage-browser-acceptance-and-release-pipeline)
and [DOM-05 clock/traceability](campaign-domain.md#dom-05-cross-domain-acceptance-harness)
are implemented for their admitted scope. Eight M0 review/fix rounds and
post-correction validation are complete; see the latest
[milestone evidence](milestones.md#phase-0-skeleton). PR #8 merged through the
human-approved queue on September 8, 2026, with all CI checks passing; M0 is
complete and Phase 1 is authorized. No formal review gate is released. Do not wait for
Phase 1's database-backed ARC-02 integration or mark that work complete early.

1. [ARC-01](architecture.md#arc-01-dependency-decisions-and-package-skeleton) → [DOM-01](campaign-domain.md#dom-01-domain-vocabulary-and-decision-records) → [ARC-02](architecture.md#arc-02-shared-cli-configuration-paths-and-app-startup) → [OPS-01](operations.md#ops-01-development-and-production-compose-topology).
2. Start [OPS-09](operations.md#ops-09-ci-coverage-browser-acceptance-and-release-pipeline) baseline CI/coverage and [DOM-05](campaign-domain.md#dom-05-cross-domain-acceptance-harness) clock/traceability work.
3. Complete M0 evidence and the scaffold correction pass before Phase 1.

## Phase 1A: Schema and policy

Source scope: [Phase 1A: Schema and policy](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-1-secure-foundation-and-durable-domain).

Execution checkpoint (September 9, 2026 UTC): the human merged TaskRun storage
as PR #16, merge `e5706c8a745d4cd33198918eb006180485be50b9`, after all four CI
checks passed at `4bf013ce69cf9420350accae9247a0d250665627`.
Branch `pr/stewardship-phase-1a` starts at that refreshed `origin/main`.
The human approved larger coherent delivery batches rather than further
single-component foundation PRs. The next batch targets the remaining
dependency-ready Phase 1A schema, lifecycle and authorization foundation in the
ordered packages below. Complete remaining DAT-01 prerequisites before their
consumers; retain explicit later integration ownership instead of claiming
unimplemented runtime/secret/recovery behavior is complete. Internal commits and
tests do not need routine approval. The complete batch gets three review/fix
rounds and human PR merge approval; Gate 1 still reviews the integrated foundation
before Phase 2.

Current batch checkpoint: versioned authorization, provenance, installer security
effects and offline-recovery records/services are implemented together with the
DOM-02 interval prerequisite. See the
[integration boundary and batch rationale](../../guides/stewardship-authorization-foundation.md).
This substantial policy state-machine batch precedes the separate campaign/
lifecycle/schedule state-machine batch; it does not complete Phase 1A. Remaining
DAT-01 secret/runtime integration stays explicitly open. Continue with DAT-02
and remaining DOM-02 after this PR's human-approved merge. The three full-branch
review/fix rounds and final local validation are complete; see the
[batch evidence](milestones.md#authorization-and-recovery-batch).
Human PR merge approval and passing PR CI are required before the next batch.

September 10, 2026: the human merged PR #17 as
`4e8ac93a6ec8a8c835ce1b6854bc78e25ee80b9e`. Branch
`pr/stewardship-campaign-lifecycle` starts from that refreshed `origin/main`.
The campaign configuration/lifecycle-policy batch groups versioned drafts,
schedule revisions, atomic Testing runtime selection and pure lifecycle policy.
See its [boundary](../../guides/stewardship-campaign-foundation.md) and
[evidence](milestones.md#campaign-configuration-and-lifecycle-policy-batch).
DAT-02 remains incomplete; its remaining storage/read-guard work is next before
Phase 1B consumers. No formal review gate has been released.
The batch's three independent review/fix rounds and final local validation are
complete at implementation `1edef35`; see the linked evidence. PR CI and human
merge approval are required before continuing that next batch.

The merged configuration-preparation increment completed three dual-model
review/fix rounds and final CI; see its
[dispositions and validation](milestones.md#configuration-preparation-increment).
The request-intake increment's three-round review/fix cycle is recorded in the
[milestone evidence](milestones.md#configuration-request-intake-increment).
PR #11 merged after all four CI checks passed. The activation increment completed
three independent review/fix rounds, all accepted Medium+ corrections, and full
local validation; see its
[final evidence](milestones.md#configuration-activation-increment).
PR #12 merged with all four checks passing. The secret-request increment gets
its own human-approved PR after three completed independent review/fix rounds,
all accepted Medium+ corrections and passing local validation; see its
[final evidence](milestones.md#secret-request-storage-increment).
PR #13 merged with all four checks passing. The audit-ownership increment has
completed three independent dual-model review/fix rounds and final local
validation; see its [evidence](milestones.md#audit-ownership-increment).
PR #15 merged with all four checks passing. The TaskRun increment completed
three independent dual-model review/fix rounds, final local validation and CI,
and merged as PR #16; see its
[evidence](milestones.md#taskrun-storage-increment). None of these increments
releases the incomplete Phase 1 or Gate 1.

Integrate ARC-02's concrete materializer and database-backed digest/mode checks
with DAT-01. Complete its production prerequisite and recovery verification in
Phase 1C, following the controlling plan; all existing review gates remain.

1. [DAT-01](data.md#dat-01-storage-conventions-and-base-records) → [DOM-02](campaign-domain.md#dom-02-campaign-interval-and-lifecycle-policy).01 interval resolver → [DAT-02](data.md#dat-02-campaign-lifecycle-and-schedule-schema) → remaining [DOM-02](campaign-domain.md#dom-02-campaign-interval-and-lifecycle-policy) policy.
2. [DAT-05](data.md#dat-05-portal-users-and-authorization-policy-records) → [DOM-03](campaign-domain.md#dom-03-authorization-capability-policy); start database-backed [DOM-05](campaign-domain.md#dom-05-cross-domain-acceptance-harness) factories after [DAT-01](data.md#dat-01-storage-conventions-and-base-records).

September 10, 2026: PR #18 merged as
`9f644b0e1fdef1fb09e009bc1576f979c096f643`. The completion branch
`pr/stewardship-phase-1a-completion` targets **all remaining Phase 1A work** in
one PR, as explicitly requested. Its
[execution checkpoints and integration contracts](../../guides/stewardship-phase-1a-completion.md)
cover DAT-02, persistent DOM-02 integration and initial database-backed DOM-05
builders. Phase 1A implementation and local validation are complete; Gate 1
remains after the integrated Phase 1B/1C foundation.
The implementation scope is now complete: DAT-02.01–.05 and DOM-02.03–.05 are
checked with PostgreSQL evidence, and DAT-01/DAT-05/DOM-03/DOM-05 explicitly
separate their completed Phase 1A portions from later consumers. Four independent
full-branch dual-model review/fix rounds are complete. Round 3's High callback
issue was corrected before round 4, which found no High/Critical issues; all
accepted Medium+ findings are resolved. Final validation passes 1,958 baseline
and 634 PostgreSQL tests, plus all 30 rebuilt-image/Compose checks. CI and human
merge approval are tracked on the associated completion PR. After its merge, the
next dependency-ready batch is **Phase 1B**, starting with ARC-03; do not create
another Phase 1A foundation increment.

## Phase 1B: Identity and web foundations

Source scope: [Phase 1B: Identity and web foundations](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-1-secure-foundation-and-durable-domain).

September 10, 2026: PR #19 merged at
`6fd21eb586a635333be9f55fc7db9caa39284e60`. The branch
`pr/stewardship-phase-1b` starts at that tip and carries the complete Phase 1B
assignment as one coherent PR. Its [execution checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-phase-1b.md)
track implementation and validation; Gate 1 is not released.

Current implementation SHA: `120e10552b1e51d1810f58fec23148eed65bf17a`.
All Phase 1B code scope and its three rounds of review
corrections are implemented. The third review had no High/Critical findings.
Final integrated validation passes. The owner approved the secure-link
audit-retention clarification, closing the three-round review exit. See the
[review ledger](../../guides/stewardship-phase-1b-reviews.md#round-three).
Do not begin Phase 1C until PR CI and human-approved merge are complete.

1. [ARC-03](architecture.md#arc-03-django-web-foundation-and-security-middleware) → [ARC-04](architecture.md#arc-04-google-identity-authorization-sessions-and-denial-paths) with [ADM-01](admin-portal.md#adm-01-login-denial-and-unconfigured-state-routing) integration.
2. [DAT-04](data.md#dat-04-family-campaign-identity-and-credentials) credential/schema foundation → [ARC-05](architecture.md#arc-05-family-code-token-and-family-session-security).
3. [ARC-06](architecture.md#arc-06-enforceable-cryptographic-service-boundary) → [ARC-07](architecture.md#arc-07-application-level-privacy-and-audit-primitives) → initial [ARC-08](architecture.md#arc-08-performance-accessibility-and-compatibility-baseline) and [DOM-04](campaign-domain.md#dom-04-shared-presentation-and-client-contracts).

## Phase 1C: Runtime foundation

Source scope: [Phase 1C: Runtime foundation](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-1-secure-foundation-and-durable-domain).

PR #20 merged at `18a37cb5b6c90bbf2b5f60c5fff37f199cd52201` after passing
PR and merge-queue CI. The owner authorized continuing directly into Phase 1C.
Branch `pr/stewardship-phase-1c` starts at that refreshed `origin/main` tip;
its [execution evidence](../../guides/stewardship-phase-1c.md) tracks the complete
batch. Implementation, review and native Linux CI validation are complete.
Human merge/Gate 1 release remains required, with passing CI on the final PR head.

The operational implementation and its native-volume/production-shaped tests
are present. Round one reviewed this phase; round two reviewed the complete
Phase 1 diff from `509245d`, and round three repeated that cumulative scope.
Both vendors completed all three reviews successfully; round three found no
High/Critical issues. All retained findings have corrections or evidence-backed
rejections. Corrected implementation `e3fed5c`, with the fixture-only CI fixes
through `243782d`, passes 2,710 baseline tests,
991 PostgreSQL tests, 48 rebuilt-container checks and 75 browser checks, with
92.45% line and 84.50% branch coverage. See the
[review ledger](../../guides/stewardship-phase-1c-reviews.md) for the single
Phase 1C [PR #21](https://github.com/epiphany40223/parishkit/pull/21) handoff.
All native Linux CI jobs pass at `243782d`; final-head CI and human approval
remain mandatory before merging or beginning Phase 2.
Do not start DAT-03 until Gate 1 and the phase PR receive human approval.

1. [OPS-02](operations.md#ops-02-durable-runtime-paths-and-least-privilege-secrets) → [OPS-03](operations.md#ops-03-production-ingress-tls-and-network-security) → [OPS-04](operations.md#ops-04-bootstrap-migrations-startup-and-upgrades) → baseline [OPS-08](operations.md#ops-08-observability-health-and-operational-runbooks).
2. Complete M1 evidence and G1 before beginning Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Source, setup, and preparation

Source scope: [Phase 2: Source, setup, and preparation](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-2-source-truth-initial-setup-and-campaign-preparation).

September 11, 2026: PR #21 merged as
`48be3666f0c89cc15586cb67465cd1ba0504203c` after passing merge-queue CI. The owner
authorized automatic continuation upon that merge, releasing Gate 1. Branch
`pr/stewardship-phase-2` starts from the refreshed `origin/main` tip and targets
the complete Phase 2 batch below, not a separate PR per storage component.
Its [execution checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md) track scope,
tests and the required three-round review/fix cycle. DAT-03 storage and the
background/source pipeline, complete initial setup and Admin campaign preparation
have been implemented. Integrated validation and three full-phase review/fix
rounds pass at corrected implementation `ea2d5cb`; the final round found no
High/Critical issues and all retained findings are resolved. The
[acceptance index](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2-acceptance.md) records all
demonstrations, test counts and coverage. DAT-03, BG-01, BG-05, ADM-02, ADM-03,
ADM-04 and M2 are complete for this phase; DAT-04/DAT-05 retain only their named
later consumers. PR #22's post-consolidation CI passes, and the
[supplemental review gate](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2-consolidation-review.md)
is complete with a second successful dual-source round, no High/Critical
findings and passing correction tests. The authorized merge landed on
`origin/main` as recorded in Phase 3A below, after final-head and merge-group CI
passed. The pre-consolidation SHAs above remain historical evidence, not
acceptance of subsequent corrections.

1. [DAT-03](data.md#dat-03-versioned-parishsoft-source-corpus) → [BG-01](background-processing.md#bg-01-durable-task-scheduler-lease-and-recovery-substrate) → [BG-05](background-processing.md#bg-05-parishsoft-delta-and-full-refresh) → [ADM-02](admin-portal.md#adm-02-bootstrap-command-and-transactional-setup-wizard) → [ADM-03](admin-portal.md#adm-03-navigation-dashboard-indicators-and-configuration) → [ADM-04](admin-portal.md#adm-04-campaign-editor-content-schedules-and-previews).
2. Complete source-promotion integration for [DAT-04](data.md#dat-04-family-campaign-identity-and-credentials) population and [DAT-05](data.md#dat-05-portal-users-and-authorization-policy-records) chair suggestions.
3. Complete M2 evidence and the focused setup/import correction pass.

## Phase 3A: Minimal Family slice

Source scope: [Phase 3A: Minimal Family slice](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-3-complete-family-response-vertical-slice).

September 13, 2026: PR #22 merged as
`7b2b1dd4478ae4014b167d6c0c203127c9a0ceb9`, verified on refreshed `origin/main`.
Final-head and merge-group CI passed, and the completed supplemental reviews
closed Phase 2's correction gate. Branch `pr/stewardship-family-response` starts
from that tip. The [Phase 3A checkpoint](../../guides/stewardship-phase-3a.md)
tracks the minimal Family response increment, beginning with DAT-06's trusted
baseline/submission contract. Gate 2 remains open until Phase 3B completes its
integrated review; this branch does not include all remaining Family modules.

The minimal flow and DOM-05 executable scenario are implemented, including
restricted-role SQL guards, source reconciliation, real connection races,
mobile browser navigation and final-submit/revisit handling. All three
dual-model review rounds are complete; round three had no High/Critical
findings and both Medium corrections have passing regression tests. See the
[review ledger](../../guides/stewardship-phase-3a-reviews.md#round-3).
Final targeted local validation passes, including the complete 492-test browser
suite. The ledger retains the earlier broad database run's clock-regression
failure and passing recheck. PR #23 then passed clean final-head CI, including
all 2,220 database tests and coverage of 93.93% statements / 85.18% branches,
and merged through the protected queue as
`4051b4a5250cdbfa4a8f41d23d9fab800f252b84` on September 13, 2026.
The owning checklists retain partial scope for packages whose
remaining fields, modules or downstream consumers belong to later increments.

1. [DAT-06](data.md#dat-06-immutable-submissions-and-proposal-overlay) → submission/follow-up slice of [DAT-07](data.md#dat-07-follow-up-content-templates-jobs-and-audit) → [DAT-08](data.md#dat-08-merge-and-source-reconciliation-services).
2. [FAM-01](parishioner-portal.md#fam-01-availability-code-entry-and-secure-link-exchange) → [FAM-02](parishioner-portal.md#fam-02-in-memory-form-engine-and-navigation) → minimal [FAM-03](parishioner-portal.md#fam-03-family-census-step) and [FAM-06](parishioner-portal.md#fam-06-additional-information-review-and-atomic-submit) response flow.
3. Land the first executable [DOM-05](campaign-domain.md#dom-05-cross-domain-acceptance-harness) Family scenario before expanding fields.

## Phase 3B: Complete Family flow

Source scope: [Phase 3B: Complete Family flow](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-3-complete-family-response-vertical-slice).

Branch `pr/stewardship-family-census` starts at the verified PR #23 merge on
refreshed `origin/main`. Its first coherent outcome is the FAM-03 household
census step; see the [increment checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-family-census.md).
The controlling plan records why remaining Member and stewardship-module
work follows separately. Gate 2 is not released by this subdivision.

The household implementation and its three review/correction rounds are
complete with [recorded evidence](../../guides/stewardship-family-census-reviews.md);
PR #24's final-head and merge-group CI passed and its protected merge is
verified on `origin/main`. FAM-03.01 through .04 are
complete. The remaining FAM-03.05 non-census omission integration accompanies
FAM-05.06 rather than blocking the next Member-census increment.

Branch `pr/stewardship-member-census` starts from that merged tip, `5c478e8`.
Its [bounded scope](../../guides/stewardship-member-census.md) is existing
Members' non-terminal census fields, including end-to-end validation and
revisit. Implementation, local validation and three dual-model review/correction
rounds are complete; final-head and merge-group CI passed, and PR #25 merged
as `eeb3463`, verified on `origin/main`.
Branch `pr/stewardship-member-requests` starts from that exact tip. Its
[increment checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-member-requests.md) cover
terminal semantics and proposed Members. FAM-04 implementation and local
acceptance are complete, including three dual-model review/fix rounds with
[recorded evidence](../../guides/stewardship-member-requests-reviews.md).
PR #26 passed final-head CI and merged through the protected queue as
`047f0f4`, verified on `origin/main`. Branch `pr/stewardship-ministry-responses`
starts there; its [increment checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-ministry-responses.md)
cover FAM-05 Ministry choices, roster resolution and non-census omission.
The Ministry implementation, three review/fix rounds and final-head/merge-group
CI passed. PR #27 merged as `6e493657`, verified on `origin/main`; see its
[delivery ledger](../../guides/stewardship-ministry-responses-reviews.md#final-ci-and-protected-merge).
Before financial work, a small [OPS-09 browser-CI increment](../../guides/stewardship-browser-ci.md)
reduces the measured 15–17-minute browser critical path while retaining the
complete suite and protected aggregate check. Branch
`pr/stewardship-browser-ci` starts at the PR #27 merge. Its implementation,
five dual-source review/fix rounds and local validation are complete, including
the container-baseline timeout and oversized-log corrections. PR #28 passed
final-head and protected merge-group CI and merged as
`c0ab9a1259c6a2c459b6568917e2da56278f061b`, verified on `origin/main`.
The [financial-response increment](../../guides/stewardship-financial-responses.md)
starts from that merge. FAM-05.03–.06 implementation and three dual-model
review/fix rounds are complete, with all accepted Medium+ findings corrected.
The linked ledger records local validation and the audited schema-fingerprint
correction. PR #29 passed final-head and complete merge-group CI and merged as
`e406ecfa5af136aa06b67e5461bc1389360b2a8b`, verified on refreshed `origin/main`.
Branch `pr/stewardship-family-acceptance` starts at that tip. Its
[integrated acceptance scope](../../guides/stewardship-family-acceptance.md) closes the remaining
FAM-01/02/06/07 evidence, exercises representative FAM-08, completes the Phase 3
demonstration, and reviews the entire Gate 2 scope before any Phase 4 work.

Local acceptance is complete at `44455b5`: FAM-01–07 and DAT-06/08's Family
service scope pass five dual review rounds and complete baseline/database/browser
validation. The [final evidence](../../guides/stewardship-gate-2-reviews.md#final-correction-review-and-passing-local-gate)
retains all failure/correction history and later-phase boundaries. Protected
delivery, G2.06 and the Phase 4 release remain pending exact-head and complete
merge-group CI plus verified main ancestry.

Completion: [PR #30](../../guides/stewardship-gate-2-reviews.md#protected-delivery)
merged as `6c8cd512e5121095961ffbeb3f80f4dfd844043c` after seven successful
dual-source rounds, final-head CI and every merge-group job passed. The merge
is verified on `origin/main`; the earlier pending delivery checkpoint above is
superseded. M3.05/G2.06 are complete and Phase 4 is dependency-ready.

1. Finish [FAM-03](parishioner-portal.md#fam-03-family-census-step); complete [FAM-04](parishioner-portal.md#fam-04-existing-and-proposed-member-steps), [FAM-05](parishioner-portal.md#fam-05-ministry-and-financial-stewardship-steps), [FAM-06](parishioner-portal.md#fam-06-additional-information-review-and-atomic-submit), and [FAM-07](parishioner-portal.md#fam-07-repeat-visits-and-source-change-merge).
2. Exercise representative [FAM-08](parishioner-portal.md#fam-08-responsive-accessibility-privacy-and-browser-completion) cases continuously.
3. Complete [DAT-07](data.md#dat-07-follow-up-content-templates-jobs-and-audit) follow-up derivation and required [RPT-02](reports.md#rpt-02-population-and-calculation-library) calculations.
4. Complete M3 evidence and G2 before starting Production mail work.

## Phase 4: Production scheduling and delivery

Source scope: [Phase 4: Production scheduling and delivery](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-4-production-scheduling-delivery-and-notifications).

Completed increment: `pr/stewardship-delivery-journal` starts at the verified
PR #30 merge. Begin DAT-07's durable outbox and Production-transition journal
services with their state, ownership, scrubbing and concurrency tests. This is
a coherent delivery-state foundation, not a PR per model. Its
[scope and checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-delivery-journal.md) preserve the
later cleanup/scheduler/dispatch/UI owners and Gate 3 restrictions. No Phase 4
task is yet claimed wholly complete. The journal slice now has three successful
dual-source review/fix rounds and passing local regression/schema evidence in
its [review ledger](../../guides/stewardship-delivery-reviews.md#third-correction-review).
Final-head CI and complete merge-group validation subsequently passed, and
PR #31 merged as `f4e000c5b3f7024e47c7f6d3dbdd30c6cd4976e1`, verified on
refreshed `origin/main`. The next branch, `pr/stewardship-campaign-boundaries`,
starts at that exact tip. Its [scope and checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-campaign-boundaries.md)
cover BG-02's Phase 4 start/close behavior; BG-03/04 continue afterward in the
order below. Restore/reopen token preparation and Gate 3 remain later work.

Boundary delivery checkpoint: BG-02.01/.02/.04/.05 and BG-02.03's end-date
replacement portion pass local acceptance and three dual-source review/fix
rounds. The [boundary review ledger](../../guides/stewardship-campaign-boundaries.md#review-round-3)
records exact heads, raw severities, dispositions and validation. BG-02.03
remains unchecked for its Phase 6 token worker. All 24 final-head PR CI jobs
and all 24 merge-group jobs passed. PR #32 merged as
`5c85d26ff586cad5539ff2c324c89cd621cbcf9d`, verified on refreshed `origin/main`.
BG-03 on `pr/stewardship-production-cleanup` now passes local acceptance and
three dual-source review/fix rounds. Its
[scope and checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-production-cleanup.md) retain
the later readiness, mail and activation owners. Final-head PR and protected
merge-group CI must pass before delivery; then continue BG-04 from the verified
merged tip. This checkpoint does not release Gate 3.

## Completion

Completion requires all 371 implementation tasks, all linked package definitions
of done, M0 through M7 demonstrations, and G1 through G5 review evidence. A
passing unit suite or a completed portal alone does not close the project.
Keep the task index, this navigation map, and the controlling plan synchronized
when scope or ordering changes.
