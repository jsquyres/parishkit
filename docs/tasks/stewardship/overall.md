# Stewardship top-level task execution plan

Start here to coordinate all eight [subsystem task lists](README.md). This is
the task-level navigation companion to the
[controlling implementation plan](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md), which
owns dependency ordering, allowed phase scope, and gate exit requirements.
Use [milestones](milestones.md) for demonstration and review status.

## How to select the next work

1. Find the earliest incomplete phase whose preceding review gate has passed.
2. Follow the ordered package links below; within a package, inspect its full
   plan item, task evidence, and dependencies before selecting work.
3. Deliver a bounded increment, verify it, and update only its owning task list.
   Record partial scope when a package spans phases; do not mark a whole package
   done because its first consumer works.
4. Complete the phase demonstration. At a formal gate, stop feature work, run
   two independent reviews, correct findings, rerun validation and review, and
   record the required approval before proceeding.
5. On handoff, record active phase, completed task IDs, implementation SHA,
   validation evidence, remaining scope, and the next dependency-ready task.

The sequences below reference packages; a suffix such as `DOM-02.01` identifies
one task. Ranges mean every intervening package in the linked subsystem file.
M0 through M7 and G1 through G5 are evidence checklists in [milestones](milestones.md),
not duplicate implementation tasks. Each phase heading links to its complete
source scope so exceptions and demonstrations are not redefined here.

## Phase 0: Skeleton

Source scope: [Phase 0: Skeleton](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-0-reproducible-project-skeleton).

Execution checkpoint (September 7, 2026): the human approved the ARC-02 phase
split now recorded in the controlling plan. See its
[partial completion evidence](architecture.md#arc-02-shared-cli-configuration-paths-and-app-startup).
ARC-01 and DOM-01 evidence is recorded in their owning checklists. Docker is
reachable, but Compose demonstrations and M0 review have not been run. No later
phase or review gate is released.
Continue the remaining Phase 0 scope, then OPS-01; do not wait for Phase 1's
database-backed ARC-02 integration or mark that work complete prematurely.

1. [ARC-01](architecture.md#arc-01-dependency-decisions-and-package-skeleton) → [DOM-01](campaign-domain.md#dom-01-domain-vocabulary-and-decision-records) → [ARC-02](architecture.md#arc-02-shared-cli-configuration-paths-and-app-startup) → [OPS-01](operations.md#ops-01-development-and-production-compose-topology).
2. Start [OPS-09](operations.md#ops-09-ci-coverage-browser-acceptance-and-release-pipeline) baseline CI/coverage and [DOM-05](campaign-domain.md#dom-05-cross-domain-acceptance-harness) clock/traceability work.
3. Complete M0 evidence and the scaffold correction pass before Phase 1.

## Phase 1A: Schema and policy

Source scope: [Phase 1A: Schema and policy](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-1-secure-foundation-and-durable-domain).

Integrate ARC-02's concrete materializer and database-backed digest/mode checks
with DAT-01. Complete its production prerequisite and recovery verification in
Phase 1C, following the controlling plan; all existing review gates remain.

1. [DAT-01](data.md#dat-01-storage-conventions-and-base-records) → [DOM-02](campaign-domain.md#dom-02-campaign-interval-and-lifecycle-policy).01 interval resolver → [DAT-02](data.md#dat-02-campaign-lifecycle-and-schedule-schema) → remaining [DOM-02](campaign-domain.md#dom-02-campaign-interval-and-lifecycle-policy) policy.
2. [DAT-05](data.md#dat-05-portal-users-and-authorization-policy-records) → [DOM-03](campaign-domain.md#dom-03-authorization-capability-policy); start database-backed [DOM-05](campaign-domain.md#dom-05-cross-domain-acceptance-harness) factories after [DAT-01](data.md#dat-01-storage-conventions-and-base-records).

3. [ARC-06](architecture.md#arc-06-enforceable-cryptographic-service-boundary) → [ARC-07](architecture.md#arc-07-application-level-privacy-and-audit-primitives) → initial [ARC-08](architecture.md#arc-08-performance-accessibility-and-compatibility-baseline) and [DOM-04](campaign-domain.md#dom-04-shared-presentation-and-client-contracts).

## Completion

Completion requires all 371 implementation tasks, all linked package definitions
of done, M0 through M7 demonstrations, and G1 through G5 review evidence. A
passing unit suite or a completed portal alone does not close the project.
Keep the task index, this navigation map, and the controlling plan synchronized
when scope or ordering changes.
