## OPS-01: Development and production Compose topology

Scope and dependencies: [OPS-01 work package](../../plans/stewardship/operations.md#ops-01-development-and-production-compose-topology).

- [x] OPS-01.01 — Create development and production Compose definitions.
- [ ] OPS-01.02 — Build one non-root image with explicit service commands.
- [x] OPS-01.03 — Implement cross-platform bind-mounted development reload.
- [x] OPS-01.04 — Restrict service ports to the intended networks.
- [x] OPS-01.05 — Test and document Compose startup.

Evidence: Phase 0 Compose scaffold commit `72f31f3` on
`pr/stewardship-implementation`. See the
[Compose guide](../../development/stewardship-compose.md),
[`deploy/stewardship`](../../../deploy/stewardship/),
[`test_services.py`](../../../tests/stewardship/test_services.py), and
[`test_compose.py`](../../../tests/stewardship/test_compose.py).
September 7, 2026: application image built on macOS/arm64 with Docker 29.7.2 and
Compose 5.3.1. Host and in-image baseline each passed 570 tests (3 explicitly
opt-in Docker checks skipped). The separately enabled Compose suite passed
5 tests, including both rendered overlays, real source reload, localhost/internal
route checks, no token-bearing access logs, non-root web execution, synthetic
PostgreSQL/Valkey persistence across replacement, production startup refusal,
and graceful web stop/restart. Ruff and Markdown checks passed. Both architecture
manifests are pinned; native Windows/Linux-host and amd64 execution are not yet
claimed and will receive CI/runtime evidence in OPS-09.

OPS-01.02 is partial: one non-root image provides the working development web
entry point, init/signal handling, read-only root, and local liveness probe.
Reserved worker/installer/operator identities have no credential/data mounts
and explicitly refuse startup; they do not pretend to process work or pass
health checks. Their concrete commands/mounts/readiness arrive with the owning
ARC-06, background, and OPS-02/04 packages. Production remains fail-closed.
OPS-02 still owns CLI/YAML-to-Compose path integration, full provisioning, and
mount/queue isolation. No review gate, deployment, or release is claimed.

## OPS-02: Durable runtime paths and least-privilege secrets

Scope and dependencies: [OPS-02 work package](../../plans/stewardship/operations.md#ops-02-durable-runtime-paths-and-least-privilege-secrets).

Evidence: Not started.

## OPS-05: Backup service and purge-triggered backup

Scope and dependencies: [OPS-05 work package](../../plans/stewardship/operations.md#ops-05-backup-service-and-purge-triggered-backup).

- [ ] OPS-05.01 — Implement consistent data/config/media backup manifests.
- [ ] OPS-05.02 — Encrypt, transfer, verify, and retain complete backups.
- [ ] OPS-05.03 — Route backup creation and revalidation through the isolated backup worker.
- [ ] OPS-05.04 — Implement operator-only secret escrow and off-host recovery verification.
- [ ] OPS-05.05 — Test backup failures, revalidation, retention, RPO alerts, and restore evidence.

Evidence: Not started.

## OPS-06: Restore and state-aware release

Scope and dependencies: [OPS-06 work package](../../plans/stewardship/operations.md#ops-06-restore-and-state-aware-release).

- [ ] OPS-06.01 — Implement validated empty-target and disaster-recovery restore.
- [ ] OPS-06.02 — Restore data, invalidate sessions/link generations, and set maintenance gates.
- [ ] OPS-06.03 — Implement restricted maintenance queues and controls.
- [ ] OPS-06.04 — Inventory uncertain deliveries and durable holds.
- [ ] OPS-06.05 — Integrate atomic lifecycle-aware release with fresh link-token activation.
- [ ] OPS-06.06 — Test every restore state, uncertainty window, and resend case.

## OPS-08: Observability, health, and operational runbooks

- [ ] OPS-08.01 — Implement structured operational and audit logging.
- [ ] OPS-08.02 — Implement internal authenticated metrics and credential rotation.
- [ ] OPS-08.03 — Implement minimal health and detailed CLI diagnostics.
- [ ] OPS-08.04 — Integrate deduplicated alerts and recovery status.
- [ ] OPS-08.05 — Write operational failure and recovery runbooks.
- [ ] OPS-08.06 — Exercise runbooks using controlled failure injection.

Evidence: Not started.

## OPS-09: CI, coverage, browser, acceptance, and release pipeline

Scope and dependencies: [OPS-09 work package](../../plans/stewardship/operations.md#ops-09-ci-coverage-browser-acceptance-and-release-pipeline).

- [ ] OPS-09.01 — Build repository lint, test, migration, and frontend CI.
- [x] OPS-09.02 — Enforce separate scoped line and branch coverage floors.
- [ ] OPS-09.03 — Build integration, browser, Compose, and image validation jobs.
- [ ] OPS-09.04 — Provide credential-free CI and human-run smoke tools.
- [ ] OPS-09.05 — Complete required suites, saturated-download load tests, and acceptance traceability.
- [ ] OPS-09.06 — Publish release artifacts only after the authorized final gate.

Evidence: Phase 0 coverage/CI commit `8557a78` on
`pr/stewardship-implementation`. The mandatory package plus exact shared CLI/config/path modules
are declared in [`coverage-stewardship.toml`](../../../coverage-stewardship.toml).
The [coverage runner](../../../src/parishkit/stewardship/quality.py) derives its
pytest-cov source arguments from the validated manifest and rejects incomplete
or non-branch reports before evaluating independent floors. Its 33 regression
tests include each invalid-manifest category and either-floor-only failures.
September 7, 2026: the complete host runner passed 603 tests (3 opt-in Docker
checks skipped), with 96.91% lines and 95.22% branches. Migration drift reported
no changes. Ruff and Markdown checks passed.

OPS-09.01 is partial: required lint/format/Markdown, manifest-derived coverage,
and scaffold migration drift are in CI; database-backed migration and frontend
checks follow their implementation. OPS-09.03 now defines a Linux CI image-build
and isolated Compose smoke job; remote execution is not yet claimed. The earlier
macOS/arm64 smoke evidence remains under OPS-01. Browser/accessibility, full
database integrations, multi-architecture release/SBOM/scanning/provenance, all
acceptance/load suites, and real-provider human-run smoke tools remain open.
All current tests are fake-backed. No image or release tag is published.
