# Stewardship milestones and review tasks

[Task index](README.md) · [Task execution plan](overall.md) ·
[Controlling plan](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md)

Implementation completion lives in the eight subsystem task lists. This file
tracks integration evidence and gate completion, not a second copy of package
status. Execute each phase's exact package order and partial-package scope from
the controlling plan. A review gate remains open until its whole protocol and
exit criteria pass, even if all implementation checkboxes are checked.

## Phase 0: Skeleton

Scope: [Phase 0](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-0-reproducible-project-skeleton).

- [x] M0.01 — Demonstrate local bind-mount reload, routes, and internal health.
- [x] M0.02 — Run the same baseline tests on the host and in the image.
- [x] M0.03 — Demonstrate safe startup rejection for incomplete production settings.
- [ ] M0.04 — Review and correct the scaffold before foundation work.

Evidence: September 7, 2026, macOS/arm64 host and Linux/arm64 image. The
[OPS-01 evidence](operations.md#ops-01-development-and-production-compose-topology)
records 570 passing baseline tests on both environments and 5 passing opt-in
Compose checks. Production rejects startup rather than using development keys.
OPS-09 coverage/CI and DOM-05 clock/traceability now implement their Phase 0
scope. Final pre-review validation passed 614 tests on both host and rebuilt
image (3 opt-in checks skipped), and all 5 separately enabled Compose tests.
Host scoped coverage is 96.99% lines and 95.29% branches. M0.04 has not run;
no foundation work or formal gate is released.
