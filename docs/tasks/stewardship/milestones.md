# Stewardship milestones and review tasks

[Task index](README.md) · [Task execution plan](overall.md) ·
[Controlling plan](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md)

Implementation completion lives in the eight subsystem task lists. This file
tracks integration evidence and gate completion, not a second copy of package
status. Execute each phase's exact package order and partial-package scope from
the controlling plan. A review gate remains open until its whole protocol and
exit criteria pass, even if all implementation checkboxes are checked.

## Phase 0: Skeleton

Scope: [Phase 0](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#phase-0-reproducible-project-skeleton).

- [x] M0.01 — Demonstrate local bind-mount reload, routes, and internal health.
- [x] M0.02 — Run the same baseline tests on the host and in the image.
- [x] M0.03 — Demonstrate safe startup rejection for incomplete production settings.
- [ ] M0.04 — Review and correct the scaffold before foundation work.

Evidence: September 7, 2026, macOS/arm64 host and Linux/arm64 image. The
[OPS-01 evidence](operations.md#ops-01-development-and-production-compose-topology)
records 570 passing baseline tests on both environments and 5 passing opt-in
Compose checks. Production rejects startup rather than using development keys.
OPS-09 coverage/CI and DOM-05 clock/traceability now implement their Phase 0
scope. Final pre-review validation passed 614 tests on both host and rebuilt
image (3 opt-in checks skipped), and all 5 separately enabled Compose tests.
Host scoped coverage is 96.99% lines and 95.29% branches at that pre-review SHA.
M0.04 is in progress; no foundation work or formal gate is released.

First M0 review: September 7, 2026, reviewed implementation SHA `b5bdc01`, base
`c810839`, local session `20260907-194036-a3712e`. Codex and three Claude shards
completed with no reviewer failures after the authorized findings-validation
retry. The finalized verdict was COMMENT: 12 validated Medium findings (10
Claude-only, 2 Codex-only), no agreed findings. This is not gate approval.

Initial triage (Claude findings C1–C10 and Codex findings X1–X2 in finalized
order):

- Auto-fixed C1: updated task evidence to the rebased implementation commits.
- Auto-skipped C2 as a duplicate of C1; campaign-domain evidence is corrected.
- Auto-fixed C5 and C7: logging tests now install sentinel handlers, verify
  closure/routing, and capture actual redacted stderr JSONL from root and all
  five framework/service logger routes. This tests the configuration hook,
  not future Gunicorn/Celery startup integration.
- Auto-fixed C6: wrapper documentation lists all commands and filesystem effects.
- Auto-skipped C8 as already handled by the explicit OPS-02 path-integration
  deferral in the [Compose guide](../../development/stewardship-compose.md#configuration-and-unfinished-boundaries).
  Typed deployment paths are not yet connected to a running consumer.
- Auto-skipped C9 as a false-positive: the clock helper deliberately exposes
  standard ZoneInfo errors, has no request caller, and promises no single error
  type. Request-boundary validation must accompany its future HTTP consumers.
- Auto-skipped C10 as already assigned to OPS-02/ARC-06 ownership and mount
  integration in the [authority guide](../../development/stewardship-authority.md).
  Cross-UID authority readability remains an integration requirement; the
  scaffold neither mounts these files to web nor enables production consumers.
- Fixed C3 with human approval: shared parser selection preserves existing
  tools' full option set; stewardship exposes config-only shared flags and the
  coverage runner exposes none. Command-inapplicable flags fail before dispatch,
  `--version` is standalone, and long-option abbreviations are disabled for
  stewardship. Regression tests cover real no-write rejection, all unsupported
  shared flags, all inapplicable command/option pairs before and after the
  command, redacted option diagnostics, help, and coverage-runner nonexecution.
- Fixed C4 with human approval: deployment parsing recognizes every existing
  ParishKit top-level section without interpreting other tools' fields. Unknown
  sections (including `deploymnet`) still fail. Regression tests load all eight
  tool examples with and without explicit deployment metadata, verify section
  isolation, and reject unknown names even alongside a valid deployment section.
- Fixed X1 with human approval: strict reads now bound bytes actually read,
  composition nodes/depth, and alias-expanded nodes/depth before construction
  or merge flattening. Unexpected recursion and invalid UTF-8 become sanitized
  ConfigError responses. Existing authority checks and legacy non-strict loading
  remain intact. Tests cover inclusive limits, bounded reads despite file growth,
  cycles, deep mappings/alias chains, merge amplification, ordinary alias/merge
  compatibility, and redacted deployment/CLI/authority read failures. The earlier
  isolated diagnostic reproduced the original uncaught 550-level recursion.
- Fixed X2 with human approval: host/CI installs preinstall the build lock and
  disable isolated editable-build dependency resolution. Release packaging uses
  the installed locked build tools too; no release was run. Checkout instructions
  match this order, and eight regression tests cover workflow commands, build-lock
  compatibility, Docker parity, and documentation. The test-only Compose service
  mounts the required workflow/documentation fixtures read-only.

All 12 validated findings have triage dispositions: 4 auto-fixed, 4 auto-skipped,
4 fixed with human approval, and no interactive skips or remaining decisions.
This closes the first triage pass, not M0.04 or the required re-review.

Initial corrections passed 619 host tests (3 opt-in Docker checks skipped),
Ruff checks/formatting, and tracked Markdown lint. After C3, the complete host
coverage runner passed 680 tests (3 opt-in Docker checks skipped), with 97.04%
scoped lines and 95.49% scoped branches. After C4, 703 host tests passed (3 opt-in
Docker checks skipped), with the same scoped coverage. After X1, 728 host tests
passed (3 opt-in Docker checks skipped), with 97.13% scoped lines and 95.70%
scoped branches. After X2, a fresh Python 3.12.13 environment installed both locks
successfully; `pip check` passed and all 78 applicable installed distributions
matched their lock entries. Its complete host suite passed 736 tests (3 opt-in
Docker checks skipped), with 97.13% scoped lines and 95.70% scoped branches.
Ruff checks/formatting, tracked Markdown lint, and migration drift checks passed.
The development image was rebuilt, and all 5 opt-in Compose checks passed,
including the complete in-image baseline, reload, private routes, durable
replacement, and production refusal. Corrections are committed for re-review:
pika branch mode compares committed HEAD, so the dirty-tree attempt in session
`20260907-202524-ac35dc` was aborted before Claude launch and has no verdict.
Re-review and human gate approval remain pending.

Second M0 review: September 7, 2026, reviewed clean implementation SHA `85d94e7`,
base `c810839`, local session `20260907-202815-cc5525`. Codex and three Claude
shards completed without failures. The finalized verdict was COMMENT: 14
validated Medium findings (13 Claude-only, 1 Codex-only), no agreed findings.
The six signed-off correction commits through this SHA were pushed before
review. M0.04 remains open.

Second triage uses C1–C13 and X1 in this session's finalized order, independent
of the first review's identifiers. All findings were checked against current
source, callers, tests, and the approved Phase 0 scope before decisions:

- Auto-fixed C2: README local validation now includes the scoped coverage runner,
  migration drift with test settings, report-path and PowerShell guidance, and
  the Compose validation link. Two regression cases compare README commands
  with CI steps using the existing workflow-test pattern.
- Auto-fixed C6: the Compose guide identifies the checked-in Caddyfile as an
  uninstalled reference template. Operators must copy it and supply its path;
  Compose does not validate its contents. Production ingress remains disabled.
- Auto-fixed C7: the CLI deployment-validation test removes ambient deployment
  overrides and PARISHKIT_ROOT with monkeypatch. The YAML-failure tests already
  reject their invalid document before consulting environment settings.
- Auto-skipped C1 (false-positive): Django's configure_logging integration calls
  the custom hook with LOGGING settings. Its argument is required for that
  protocol; this scaffold intentionally installs a fixed redacted stderr setup,
  not arbitrary caller-supplied handlers.
- Auto-skipped C3 (false-positive): select() first reads the persisted version
  from the configured root. A missing or mistyped root fails before any write;
  atomic_write_text cannot make the described empty-root activation succeed.
  Concurrent mount/ownership integration remains assigned to OPS-02/ARC-06.
- Auto-skipped C4 (false-positive): only Money.to_string promises canonical
  output. from_string promises exact decimal value parsing, not canonical input
  rejection. Existing tests deliberately normalize strings such as 0 and 1.2.
- Auto-skipped C5 (duplicate/false-positive): same input-policy claim as C4;
  authority document hashing has no Money parser dependency. Normalizing exact
  values does not invalidate canonical output or authority digest checks.
- Auto-skipped C8 (already handled): prepare-development explicitly provisions
  only the Phase 0 layout, not configuration authority/bootstrap. OPS-02/ARC-06
  own the later typed-path provisioning and service mount integration.
- Auto-skipped C9 (already handled): standard ZoneInfo lookup errors are an
  intentional tested contract, consistent with the earlier clock disposition.
  LocalDayInterval has no request caller or promise of one exception type;
  future request-boundary validation must handle the documented input types.
- Auto-skipped C12 (false-positive): installed pytest-django metadata requires
  pytest unconditionally, but Django only under its optional django extra.
  The alleged unconditional unbounded Django upgrade does not occur; the
  supported checkout installation includes the locked stewardship dependencies.
- Fixed decision 1, C10 with human approval: the opt-in Compose lifecycle check
  independently collects the full host baseline and compares its exact node IDs
  with the actual in-image baseline run. A test-only pytest hook emits structured
  collection evidence without new dependencies or broader mounts. Comparison
  retains duplicate occurrences, ignores order only, and reports missing and
  unexpected IDs. Empty, malformed, or missing evidence fails closed. Tests
  cover equal-count substitutions, duplicates, missing IDs, and real collection
  of parameterized/skipped synthetic tests without executing their bodies.
- Fixed decision 2, C11 with human approval: added a root .dockerignore fallback
  synchronized with the Dockerfile-specific policy by a normal regression test.
  A narrow read-only mount makes that policy fixture available in image tests.
  Two opt-in scratch builds independently exercise each ignore file with only
  synthetic allowed/private files, exporting locally without publishing images.
  These checks exposed directory exceptions in the original specialized policy
  that also admitted unlisted descendants (private YAML, bytecode, and an extra
  requirements file). Removed those exceptions from both copies; explicit file
  patterns still admit all required build inputs. Both functional checks now
  pass. The guide requires maintained BuildKit/Buildx usage, records tested
  versions, and documents the fallback and limits of filename-based exclusions.
- Skipped decision 3, C13 at human direction: compatibility with older Docker
  versions is not required. No legacy Compose JSON adapter will be added. The
  guide replaces the broad v2+ claim with current maintained tooling and records
  the validated Compose 5.3.1 baseline alongside Docker/Buildx versions. The
  existing per-container JSON check already passes on that baseline. Retain the
  approved root ignore policy as defense in depth, not legacy-builder support.
- Fixed decision 4, X1 with human approval of selective redaction: stewardship
  uses an opt-in parser that replaces structured argument failures with explicit
  authored hints about recognized fields and enum choices. Raw input values,
  converter exception messages, unknown options, and extra positional tokens
  never enter syntax diagnostics. Existing safe application validation messages
  use a separate trusted path; help remains available. Both stewardship entry
  points use this policy; other ParishKit parsers are unchanged. Regression
  tests cover private values in split/equals-form options, unknown option names,
  positional values, invalid choices, missing values, converter failures, safe
  application messages, and rejection before dispatch or coverage execution.

Automatic corrections passed 738 host tests (3 opt-in Docker checks skipped),
with 97.13% scoped lines and 95.70% branches. All 87 deployment tests also passed
with deliberately conflicting/unknown ambient deployment overrides. Ruff,
formatting, and migration drift checks passed. No container rebuild, new review,
commit, or gate approval is implied by this partial triage evidence.

After C10, the complete host baseline passed 750 tests (3 opt-in Docker checks
skipped), with 97.13% scoped lines and 95.70% branches. The rebuilt development
image passed the same baseline; all 753 collected node IDs matched the host.
All 17 separately enabled Compose checks passed, including the lifecycle smoke,
reload, private routes, durable replacement, and production startup refusal.
An earlier smoke invocation overlapped test-file edits and failed; the recorded
passing validation used the stable updated files. Three decisions remain open;
no commit, push, or M0.04 approval has occurred in this triage pass.

After C11, 751 host baseline tests passed (5 opt-in Docker checks skipped), with
97.13% scoped lines and 95.70% branches. The rebuilt image passed the same
baseline and matched all 756 host collection IDs. All 19 separately enabled
Docker checks passed, including both synthetic build-context tests and the
development lifecycle. Docker Engine/CLI 29.7.2 and Buildx 0.36.0-desktop.1 were
used. Ruff, formatting, tracked Markdown lint, and diff whitespace checks passed.
Two interactive decisions remain open; changes are not committed or pushed.

After the C13 decision, one interactive finding remains (X1). Only documentation
and disposition evidence changed; Markdown lint and diff whitespace checks
passed. No compatibility code was added and no new runtime test run is claimed.

Second triage is complete: 3 auto-fixed (C2, C6, C7), 7 auto-skipped (C1, C3, C4,
C5, C8, C9, C12), 3 fixed with human approval (C10, C11, X1), and 1 skipped at
human direction (C13). All 14 findings have dispositions; none await a decision.

After X1, the complete host baseline passed 776 tests (5 opt-in Docker checks
skipped), with 97.17% scoped lines and 95.72% branches. The rebuilt image passed
the same baseline and matched all 781 host collection IDs. All 19 separately
enabled Docker checks passed. Ruff, formatting, tracked Markdown lint, migration
drift, and diff whitespace checks passed. This includes 25 new selective-error
regression cases; shared-tool behavior remains unchanged.

These corrections are committed for re-review in logical signed-off commits
after human authorization. No push is included in this commit-only handoff.
A fresh independent review of the corrected branch and human approval are still
required before M0.04 can close or foundation work can begin. Pika branch review
uses committed changes, so the next review can now cover these corrections.

### Third local review and triage

Session `20260907-215721-1698c1` reviewed clean committed HEAD `3605c28`
against `c810839`. Verdict: COMMENT, with 14 validated MEDIUM findings,
all Claude-only; no agreed findings, failed reviewers, or finalization
degradations. The human authorized parent-side validation of the existing
reviewer artifacts after reviewer-local command permissions blocked validation.
No review was rerun or posted remotely during that recovery.

Third-triage identifiers C1–C14 follow this session's finalized order; they are
independent of earlier sessions' identifiers. Initial automatic dispositions:

- Auto-fixed C11: render both Compose overlays with all profiles explicitly
  selected and require exact service-name coverage. The new assertion first
  failed for both overlays, confirming that the previous check covered only
  web, PostgreSQL, and Valkey. Rendering does not start pending services.
- Auto-fixed C12: test the provisioned development directories against the
  typed deployment defaults, with the intentional parish-authority exclusion
  and required Caddy data/config children. Full path integration stays OPS-02.
- Auto-skipped C6 (already handled): the standard ZoneInfo lookup exception is
  explicitly tested; this domain value has no configuration/request caller
  through `validate_with`. The earlier exception-contract decision still holds.
- Auto-skipped C8 (false-positive): there is no mismatched alias today, and the
  existing CLI regression asserts the authored config hint. Adding an alias
  that breaks the mapping would fail that test, contrary to the finding.
- Auto-skipped C9 (false-positive): `select()` itself calls `read_version()`
  before writing, not only through its coordinator. The claimed missing-root
  invocation fails before the shared atomic writer can create directories.
- Auto-skipped C13 (false-positive): inspection of the pinned PostgreSQL 18.6
  image's entrypoint confirms `docker_setup_env` reads the password file and
  unsets its `_FILE` variable before `gosu` re-execution. The claimed reversed
  ordering is incorrect. This does not claim native Linux-host validation.
- Auto-skipped C14 (false-positive): the pinned Caddy 2.11.4 image successfully
  adapted the unchanged template with networking disabled and a synthetic
  hostname. Its JSON puts the three internal-path 404 responses before the
  reverse proxy; in-route matcher placement is accepted by this version.

Initially seven findings awaited human decisions, in order: C1 (automated Caddy
validation now versus its existing OPS-03.05 assignment), C2 (release validation parity),
C3 (strict-loader diagnostic privacy), C4 (test-bind missing-path behavior),
C5 (Caddy hardening and explicit production prerequisites), C7 (CLI import
overhead), and C10 (host development-server listen address). C7's host import
diagnostic measured about 74 ms for `parishkit.cli`, including about 50 ms for
`requests`; this establishes avoidable imports, not a health timeout failure.

Focused validation after the two automatic test fixes: 119 tests passed,
including both all-profile Compose renders and synthetic build-context checks;
the separately gated lifecycle test was not enabled. No application runtime
behavior changed, no pending service started, and no commit, push, deployment,
release, or gate approval is implied. M0.04 remains open.

Human-approved C1 is fixed: the opt-in Compose suite now passes the committed
template over stdin to the production overlay's pinned Caddy image and runs
`caddy adapt --validate`. Exact adapted-JSON assertions cover the enclosing
host match, all three internal-path 404 rules, and their precedence over the
catch-all proxy. The disposable validation container has no networking,
published ports, or host mounts and uses temporary Caddy storage. This does
not start ingress, request certificates, or complete OPS-03's live tests.

After C1, the focused Compose/service suite passed 120 tests, with one lifecycle
test skipped because its separate opt-in was not enabled. Ruff and formatting
passed. The complete host baseline passed 777 tests with 6 Docker checks
skipped; changed Markdown and diff whitespace checks also passed. Six
interactive findings remain: C2, C3, C4, C5, C7, and C10. Nothing is committed
or pushed, and M0.04 remains open.

Human-approved C2 is fixed: release validation now runs the same scoped
line/branch coverage command and test-settings migration-drift check as CI,
before artifact building. Two regression cases require exact step parity,
including environment and failure/skip policy, and ordering before the build.
Both cases failed against the prior release workflow, then passed after the
change; all 13 build-contract tests passed.

The local scoped coverage run passed 779 tests (6 opt-in Docker checks skipped),
with 97.17% lines and 95.72% branches. The migration check detected no changes.
This validation does not execute the release workflow, build release artifacts,
or authorize publication. Five interactive findings remain: C3, C4, C5, C7,
and C10. All triage changes remain uncommitted and M0.04 remains open.

Human-approved C3 is fixed: strict YAML loading has its own diagnostic boundary
covering path expansion/existence/read failures, parsing, scalar conversion,
and top-level shape validation. It preserves authored duplicate/unhashable-key
hints, numeric parser locations, repair guidance, and resource-limit messages,
but omits configuration paths, source snippets, and chained exception details
from normal traceback rendering. Legacy non-strict loading is unchanged.

All 12 new regression cases failed against the old implementation and passed
after the fix. They exercise direct exception/traceback rendering, missing and
optional files, parser failures with and without marks, file-operation errors,
and legacy diagnostic compatibility. The focused configuration/stewardship
suite passed 185 tests. The full scoped run passed 791 tests (6 opt-in Docker
checks skipped), with 97.30% lines and 95.86% branches; Ruff and formatting
passed. Four interactive findings remain: C4, C5, C7, and C10. Nothing is
committed or pushed, and M0.04 remains open.

Human-approved C4 is fixed: all 36 short-form test-fixture mounts now use a
shared long-form read-only bind definition with `create_host_path: false`.
Their source/target pairs are unchanged, and the existing live-source mount
retains its explicit no-creation setting. A new structural regression first
failed against the old short syntax and now verifies existing checkout sources,
unique matching container targets, read-only access, and disabled creation.
The real all-profile development render also checks the complete fixture
mapping and effective mount flags.

After C4, the host scoped run passed 792 tests (6 opt-in checks skipped), with
97.30% lines and 95.86% branches. The separately enabled Compose suite passed
all 21 checks, including Caddy validation and the disposable development
lifecycle. Its in-image baseline passed 792 tests (6 skipped), matching all
798 host collection IDs. Ruff, formatting, tracked Markdown, and diff whitespace
checks passed. No image publication, deployment, commit, or push occurred.
Three interactive findings remain: C5, C7, and C10; M0.04 remains open.

Human-directed C5 is deferred to OPS-03, not claimed as runtime remediation.
The controlling plan now makes Caddy identity/capability/filesystem hardening,
restricted writable state, network isolation, and their runtime validation
explicit prerequisites for enabling ingress. Existing OPS-03.01/05 checklist
labels point to that work without adding or renumbering tasks. The Compose
comment and development guide link the unfinished boundary to its owner.
The `pending-ingress` profile and all effective runtime settings are unchanged;
neither template validation nor this documentation authorizes ingress startup.
Two interactive findings remain: C7 and C10. Nothing is committed or pushed,
and M0.04 remains open.

After the C5 documentation/comment change, the focused Compose and traceability
suite passed 21 tests, with its separately gated lifecycle check skipped.
Both real all-profile renders and pinned Caddy validation passed. Ruff,
formatting, tracked Markdown lint, and diff whitespace checks passed; no new
runtime hardening or full lifecycle run is claimed for this documentation step.

Human-approved C7 is fixed: shared argument registration and its default-value
constants now live in the provider-free `parishkit.cli_arguments` module and
remain available through `parishkit.cli`. Stewardship imports the lightweight
module directly. Flags, help text, defaults, and legacy exception-handling
imports retain their behavior. The new shared module is explicitly included
in the scoped coverage manifest and its regression test.

Five isolated-interpreter tests cover all/config/none argument registration,
CLI help, and the real healthcheck with a synthetic local response. They assert
that legacy CLI, provider modules, requests, and urllib3 remain unloaded.
The pre-fix health/help cases reproduced the unwanted imports; the three helper
cases failed because the extracted module did not yet exist. A separate test
checks the legacy re-export and shared defaults.

After C7, the host scoped run passed 798 tests (6 opt-in checks skipped), with
97.31% lines and 95.86% branches. All 21 separately enabled Compose checks
passed, including lifecycle and an in-image baseline of 798 passed/6 skipped
matching all 804 host collection IDs. Ruff, formatting, migration drift,
tracked Markdown lint, and diff whitespace checks passed. Only C10 remains
for an interactive decision. Nothing is committed or pushed; M0.04 is open.

Human-approved C10 is fixed: direct development web launches default to
`127.0.0.1:8000`. The explicit `--bind-all-interfaces` option is accepted only
for the development web service; Compose supplies it inside the container
while continuing to publish solely on host loopback. Unrelated commands,
unimplemented profiles/roles, abbreviations, and value-bearing forms are
rejected without dispatch or private-value disclosure. The service API retains
two-argument compatibility with a new default-false keyword-only opt-in.

Tests cover both bind modes across the service/profile matrix, default and
explicit CLI dispatch, options before/after commands, safe syntax errors, and
the raw/rendered Compose command and localhost port. The pre-fix default/opt-in
CLI and Compose checks failed, then passed after the change. Updated CLI and
Compose documentation warns against opting into network exposure on a host.

Third triage is complete, with all 14 finalized findings accounted for:

| Findings | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| C11, C12 | Auto-fixed: profile coverage and provisioned-path regression tests |
| C6 | Auto-skipped: intentional, previously handled timezone exception contract |
| C8, C9, C13, C14 | Auto-skipped: verified false positives |
| C1, C2, C3, C4, C7, C10 | Fixed with human approval |
| C5 | Deferred at human direction to explicit OPS-03 hardening prerequisites |

Totals: 2 auto-fixed, 5 auto-skipped, 6 interactively fixed, and 1 interactively
deferred. The final host scoped run passed 865 tests (6 opt-in Docker checks
skipped), with 97.31% lines and 95.89% branches. The rebuilt local image
`448845e0ffe6650d5aa159c1b22d73b9420ced6c504c6a924e829d1528920c59`
passed the same baseline and matched all 871 host collection IDs. All 21
separately enabled Compose checks passed. Ruff, formatting, tracked Markdown,
migration drift, and diff whitespace checks passed.

No commit, push, merge, deployment, release, or gate approval occurred during
the triage pass itself. Following human authorization, the corrections were
committed as separate logical, signed-off changes, with this evidence recorded
in a final documentation commit. No push or new review was performed as part
of that commit handoff. M0.04 remains open pending a fresh independent review
and human approval. Pika branch review reads committed HEAD, so the next review
can now cover these corrections.

### Fourth local review and initial triage

Session `20260907-225359-7d63ab` reviewed clean committed HEAD `cf1c7b9`
against `c810839`. Verdict: COMMENT, with 10 validated MEDIUM findings,
all Claude-only; no agreed findings, failed reviewers, or finalization
degradations. Of 55 raw findings, 45 fell below the reporting cutoff.
The human authorized simpler Claude launch commands after lean-ctx rejected
shell-array syntax, then parent-side validation of existing reviewer artifacts
after reviewer-local permissions blocked their self-check command. All four
Claude documents passed pika's unchanged validator; no reviewer was rerun,
finding content edited, or review posted remotely. Recovery evidence remains
in the session directory.

Fourth-triage identifiers C1–C10 follow this session's finalized order and are
independent of prior sessions' identifiers. Initial dispositions:

- Auto-fixed C2: derive the pinned Caddy adapter test's expected internal paths
  from Django's `internal_patterns`, retaining exact enclosing-route and proxy
  ordering checks. Adding an internal route now requires updating the template.
  This test-only change does not implement or enable production ingress.
- Auto-fixed C4: require each application service's UID to contain only ASCII
  decimal digits and have a nonzero numeric value. The topology assertion no
  longer accepts `root`, `root:root`, or zero-padded UID zero as non-root.
- Auto-skipped C1 (false-positive): the Dockerfile already sets both Python
  environment variables in the common image. A service-specific Compose
  environment mapping does not erase unrelated image ENV defaults, so the
  claimed runtime loss does not follow from YAML's shallow anchor merge.
- Auto-skipped C3 (false-positive/already handled): `select()` first reads and
  validates the persisted version, so an absent authority root fails before
  the atomic writer. Mount/ownership validation and concrete provisioning
  remain explicitly assigned to OPS-02/ARC-06; the development scaffold
  intentionally creates no parish authority. No new filesystem integration
  or exception-contract change is justified by the repeated missing-root claim.
- Auto-skipped C5 (false-positive): an authorized temporary-script diagnostic
  using the installed pytest exception renderer retained both the original
  AssertionError and the teardown failure, with exception chaining. The
  claimed loss of the original diagnostic is not reproduced. Cleanup errors
  still fail the test; no conversion to a warning was made.
- Auto-skipped C7 (already handled): production startup is unconditionally
  disabled, and ARC-03 explicitly owns secure production cookies, HSTS,
  CSRF, and safe proxy settings before the Phase 1 gate. No operational
  production configuration is claimed by the current development skeleton.
- Auto-skipped C10 (already handled): the fixed development-only key belongs
  to an explicitly non-persistent, unauthenticated scaffold with dummy storage.
  Direct launches default to loopback; the human-approved explicit all-interface
  opt-in remains documented. Production cannot load these settings. Real
  signing keys and authenticated runtime settings remain later-phase work.

Three findings await human decisions, in order: C6 (coverage-runner failure
diagnostics), C8 (live versus image-baked build-contract fixtures), and C9
(standalone dev-extra compatibility with global Django pytest configuration).
C6's missing-pytest example is overstated: that subprocess reports its own
nonzero exit status. Root resolution and process-launch OS failures do receive
the misleading generic message; any correction must retain private-value
redaction rather than echo arbitrary exception text.

Validation after the two test-only fixes: 100 focused tests passed, including
pinned Caddy validation, both all-profile Compose renders, and build-context
checks; the separate lifecycle opt-in was not enabled. The full host baseline
passed 865 tests with 6 opt-in Docker checks skipped. Ruff, formatting, tracked
Markdown lint, and diff whitespace checks passed. No image rebuild, full
lifecycle run, new coverage measurement, commit, push, or gate approval is
claimed for this step. M0.04 remains open.

Human-approved C6 is fixed: the coverage runner now identifies invalid repository
directories, invalid manifests, process-launch failures, and invalid report
paths/content separately, without echoing paths or exception details. Pytest's
nonzero exit status still returns unchanged before reading any stale report.
Report structure is explicitly validated so malformed JSON shapes raise
validation errors; unexpected TypeError/KeyError exceptions are no longer
silently relabeled as bad input by the runner.

The 21 initially added/strengthened cases failed against the old implementation
and passed after correction; an additional report-path failure regression also
passes. All 61 quality-runner tests passed. The complete host scoped run passed
886 tests (6 opt-in Docker checks skipped), with 97.37% lines and 95.99% branches.
Ruff, formatting, migration drift, tracked Markdown, and diff whitespace checks
passed. C8 and C9 remain for human decisions. Changes are uncommitted; no image
rebuild, Compose lifecycle run, push, or gate approval is claimed for this step.

Human-approved C8 is fixed: four narrow read-only checkout reference mounts
provide README, project metadata, and both build/runtime locks at separate
comparison paths. The test service enables a byte-for-byte freshness check;
missing, unreadable, or changed inputs fail with an authored rebuild message
without printing file contents. Image-baked metadata and installed dependencies
remain untouched. The guide documents rebuild requirements and narrow versus
directory fixture mounts; raw and rendered Compose tests enforce the paths,
read-only/no-creation flags, and activation environment variable.

Synthetic regressions cover matching inputs and each of the four changed or
missing files. A new opt-in test uses temporary reference data with networking
disabled: matching README bytes pass, then deliberately stale bytes produce
the rebuild diagnostic. It changes no checkout file or application data.

After C8, the full host scoped run passed 901 tests (7 opt-in Docker checks
skipped), with 97.37% lines and 95.99% branches. Rebuilt local image
`1a7ca5a8d9bf97dfc6495d6dca5a91fdef7d64a3f709cb4b0827e737be0f5ad8`
passed the same baseline, matching all 908 host collection IDs. All 22 separately
enabled Compose checks passed, including freshness, lifecycle, and persistence.
Ruff, formatting, migration drift, tracked Markdown, and diff whitespace checks
passed. Only C9 remains for a human decision. Nothing is committed or pushed,
and M0.04 remains open.

Human-approved C9 implementation now makes `dev` include the existing
`stewardship` extra by package self-reference, without duplicating its dependency
ranges or changing base-package requirements. Its regression first failed and
then passed; all 29 build-contract tests passed. Regenerating the universal lock
produced no changes. After lean-ctx rejected pip's requirements-file option, the
human authorized the documented uv equivalent for fresh-environment validation.

A new Python 3.12.13 environment installed only `.[dev]` with the existing locks
as constraints and passed `uv pip check` (62 installed packages). Django startup
is fixed: the full baseline collected 909 tests, with 900 passed, 7 opt-in skips,
and 2 failures in unchanged Google Drive tests because the separately optional
`googleapiclient` library is absent. The scoped runner therefore correctly failed;
its generated report is not passing final validation evidence. Expanding `dev`
to include the existing Google extra awaits human direction. No Google/provider
request or credentials were used. C9 is not yet recorded as fully validated and
triage remains open; nothing is committed or pushed.

The human subsequently approved including the existing `google` extra in `dev`
as well. C9 is now fixed and validated: one self-reference includes both owned
extras, and the regression prevents duplicate dependency declarations. The
expanded assertion first failed without Google and passed after the change.
Regenerating the universal lock still produced no changes.

A second fresh Python 3.12.13 environment installed only `.[dev]`, after the
locked build tools and with the runtime lock as constraints. `uv pip check`
passed for all 78 installed packages; the full scoped run passed 902 tests
(7 opt-in Docker checks skipped), with 97.37% lines and 95.99% branches.
No provider credentials or live calls were needed. The rebuilt local image
`a16562bd0fbbdd46197253a34b380f5ae6f1425868679b1abe399b7f1c7ff9b9`
passed the same baseline, matching all 909 host collection IDs. All 22 separately
enabled Compose checks passed. Ruff, formatting, migration drift, tracked
Markdown, and diff whitespace checks passed.

Fourth triage is complete, with all 10 finalized findings accounted for:

| Findings | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| C2, C4 | Auto-fixed: internal-route parity and numeric non-root UID tests |
| C1 | Auto-skipped: image ENV already supplies the supposedly lost settings |
| C3 | Auto-skipped: persisted-version read precedes writes; integration already assigned |
| C5 | Auto-skipped: pytest preserves both exceptions and their diagnostics |
| C7, C10 | Auto-skipped: intentional scaffold boundaries and explicit later-phase ownership |
| C6 | Fixed with human approval: stage-specific redacted coverage diagnostics |
| C8 | Fixed with human approval: separate build-input reference mounts and freshness tests |
| C9 | Fixed with human approval: standalone dev extra includes stewardship and Google dependencies |

Totals: 2 auto-fixed, 5 auto-skipped, 3 interactively fixed, and 0 interactively
skipped. No findings or decisions remain in this triage pass. During triage no
commit, push, merge, deployment, release, or gate approval occurred. The human
subsequently authorized signed-off commits and a push of the corrected PR branch.
The corrections are recorded in separate logical commits with this final
evidence handoff. M0.04 remains open pending fresh independent review and human
approval; committing or pushing does not release the gate. Pika branch review
reads committed HEAD, so the next review can now cover these corrections.

Fifth M0 review and triage: finalized September 8, 2026, reviewed SHA `fa55500`,
base `c810839`, session `20260907-234727-dfcba6`. All five Claude shards and the
Codex reviewer completed their reviews. Four Claude drafts could not run the
child-session validator; the parent subsequently validated all five artifacts
with `pika review check-findings`: all five passed. Four needed draft-to-final
promotion; the fifth had already been delivered by its reviewer. All five
artifacts were included in finalization; no shard's findings were excluded.
No findings were rewritten or reviewers rerun during delivery recovery. Finalize
reported COMMENT, 9 retained Medium findings from 49 raw (1 agreed, 7
Claude-only, 1 Codex-only), 39 below-cutoff findings, no High/Critical findings,
and no final reviewer failures, verdict mismatches, or degradations.

The human delegated routine technical/triage decisions and approved the
[automated phase delivery cycle](../../plans/stewardship/overall.md#automated-phase-delivery-cycle).
This replaces routine per-finding approval stops, not authorization boundaries
or final human PR merge approval. Identifiers below use the finalized bucket
order: agreed A1, Claude-only C1–C7, Codex-only X1.

| Finding | Disposition and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | Fixed: image-baked build-input snapshots now include Dockerfile and both ignore policies; separate checkout references cannot overwrite evidence. Synthetic changed/missing cases cover all seven inputs; Docker checks prove matching/stale recipe and ignore-policy behavior. |
| C1 | Fixed: all eight shipped example configurations pass the actual deployment loader verbatim, in addition to synthetic coexistence tests. |
| C2, C5 | Discarded as duplicates of A1; the same snapshot/reference change resolves both. |
| C3 | Fixed: development provisioning expands user paths before making them absolute; regressions verify the resolved target and absence of writes on resolution failure. |
| C4 | Fixed: deployment path resolution converts expected expansion errors to sanitized ConfigError at the owning boundary; loader and CLI regressions cover RuntimeError, ValueError, and OSError. |
| C6 | Addressed with explicit adjacent service comments: vendor infrastructure entrypoint/capability hardening belongs to OPS-02 before Gate 1. Production application startup is still unavailable, and the scaffold admits no parish data. No unsupported capability recipe was introduced in Phase 0. |
| C7 | Addressed: native Windows skips POSIX authority filesystem tests explicitly, while pure schema tests remain portable. The development guide requires Linux Compose/WSL for full authority durability validation; production fsync guarantees are not weakened. |
| X1 | Fixed: active-manifest inspection uses guarded lstat, accepts only regular files, and treats only FileNotFoundError as absence. Regression recovery rejects inaccessible entries even when pathlib predicates suppress errors. |

Validation after corrections: all 928 host tests passed with 10 opt-in Docker
checks skipped, scoped coverage 97.39% lines / 95.96% branches. The rebuilt image
`405dd37af3f19d2d90556336c81f9aa3f6fed0c9cba5b83d934376b9b95c6b19`
passed the same 928 tests/10 skips with exact parity across 938 collected IDs.
All 25 opt-in Compose tests passed, including four matching/stale input cases,
both synthetic default-deny context checks, reload, persistence, and production
refusal. Ruff, formatting, all tracked Markdown, migration drift, and whitespace
checks passed. Coverage evidence is `triage-coverage.json` in the review session.
No provider calls, deployment, release, merge, or gate approval occurred.

Five review/triage rounds are now complete. M0.04 remains open: material fixes
will receive a fresh independent review before PR/CI handoff and human merge
approval. Phase 1 has not started.

Sixth M0 review and triage: September 8, 2026, reviewed SHA `ca19f99`, base
`c810839`, session `20260908-110155-8cbc6a`. The permission preflight passed;
all five Claude shards delivered validated final artifacts without parent-side
permission recovery. Codex also completed successfully. Finalize reported
COMMENT, 11 retained Medium findings from 47 raw (1 agreed, 9 Claude-only,
1 Codex-only), 35 below-cutoff findings, no High/Critical findings, and no failed
reviewers, verdict mismatches, or degradations. Routine triage used the delegated
phase workflow, with A1/C1–C9/X1 identifiers in finalized bucket order.

| Finding | Disposition and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | Fixed: version reads now use the same guarded lstat/regular-file boundary as active manifests. Both boundaries have directory and real POSIX FIFO tests proving no YAML open occurs. |
| C1 | Clarified: OPS-01/OPS-09 counts are explicitly historical, with links to the current M0 correction/validation evidence; historical successful runs were not misrepresented as current runs. |
| C2 | Discarded: the normative operations specification explicitly names ghcr.io/\<repository\>/parishkit. The repeated parishkit segment is intentional when the GitHub repository is named parishkit. Added guide clarification and a rendered-image assertion; no image naming contract changed. |
| C3 | Fixed: the shared example set is collected once and a separate assertion requires at least the eight shipped examples, preventing empty parametrizations from silently removing coverage. |
| C4 | Discarded: the claim depends on an unimplemented ARC-03 consumer. The current public_origin contract validates a bare origin, not canonical spelling; _host strips a trailing dot only during label validation, not in its return value. No runtime consumer currently maps this value into ALLOWED_HOSTS/CSRF settings. Browser-origin integration remains owned by ARC-03 before Gate 1. |
| C5, C7 | Discarded as duplicates of A1; the version-file guard and both-boundary regressions cover them. |
| C6 | Fixed: strict YAML presence uses guarded stat, distinguishing missing/not-a-directory from access errors, and rejects non-regular inputs before open. Legacy non-strict behavior is unchanged. |
| C8 | Clarified: all five fifth-round Claude artifacts passed; four needed promotion and the fifth was already delivered. None was excluded from finalization. |
| C9, X1 | Fixed together: the coverage runner resolves and rejects checkout-local destinations, exclusively reserves a new output, and refuses existing reports without modifying them. Zero-exit pytest with no new measurement fails; tests emit reports during simulated execution rather than pre-seeding stale output. |

Post-correction host validation passed 938 tests with 10 opt-in Docker skips;
scoped coverage is 97.42% lines / 96.01% branches. The in-image baseline passed
the same 938 tests/10 skips with exact parity across 948 collected IDs. All 25
opt-in Compose checks passed. Ruff, formatting, all tracked Markdown, migration
drift, and whitespace checks passed. Coverage evidence is `triage-coverage.json`
in this session. Six rounds are complete; material input/output guard fixes
will receive independent re-review before PR/CI handoff. No merge, deployment,
release, real-provider operation, or human gate approval occurred.

Seventh M0 review and triage: September 8, 2026, reviewed SHA `7e6a4c1`, base
`c810839`, session `20260908-112244-2adbb1`. The permission preflight passed;
all five Claude shards delivered validated final artifacts without recovery,
and Codex completed successfully. Finalize reported COMMENT, three retained
Medium findings from 43 raw (one Claude-only, two Codex-only), 40 below-cutoff
Low findings, no High/Critical findings, and no failed reviewers, verdict
mismatches, or degradations. All retained findings were accepted and fixed
under delegated triage; none requires a product decision.

| Finding | Disposition and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| C1 | Fixed in f1ff517: correlation-header regression now includes a valid UUID and explicitly rejects equality with the supplied value, alongside the malformed-header case. |
| X1 | Fixed in c412c22: the coverage subprocess removes ambient PYTEST controls; regression seeds a deselection and confirms it cannot reach the child while unrelated environment values remain intact. |
| X2 | Fixed in c412c22: raw coverage uses fresh external storage beside the report, ignoring ambient COVERAGE/COV_CORE controls. Tests preserve existing checkout data under both default and overridden COVERAGE_FILE, and reject storage failures before launch. |

Post-correction validation at implementation SHA `f1ff517`: 942 host tests
passed with 10 opt-in Docker skips, scoped coverage 97.43% lines / 96.01%
branches. Rebuilt image baseline: the same 942 passes/10 skips, exact parity
across 952 collected IDs. All 25 opt-in Compose checks passed. Ruff, formatting,
all tracked Markdown, migration drift, and whitespace checks passed. Coverage
evidence is `triage-coverage.json` in this session; the runner also retains its
raw database in fresh external diagnostic storage.

Seven review/fix rounds are complete. The final correction pass changes only
developer validation and regression tests, not application behavior. The
automated loop exit criteria are satisfied: at least three completed rounds,
no final-round High/Critical findings, no unresolved accepted Medium-or-higher
findings, and passing validation. Proceed to PR/CI handoff; M0.04 remains open
for human merge approval. No Phase 1 work, merge, deployment, release, real
provider operation, or gate approval is authorized by this evidence.
