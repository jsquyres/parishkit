Each task maps to the same numbered item in its linked work package. Read that

## ARC-01: Dependency decisions and package skeleton

Scope and dependencies: [ARC-01 work package](../../plans/stewardship/architecture.md#arc-01-dependency-decisions-and-package-skeleton).

- [x] ARC-01.01 — Record and pin supported dependency lines.
- [x] ARC-01.02 — Create the Django project and app boundaries.
- [x] ARC-01.03 — Configure validated development, test, and production settings.
- [x] ARC-01.04 — Add the console entry point and thin wrapper.
- [x] ARC-01.05 — Create URL namespaces and intentional placeholders.
- [x] ARC-01.06 — Test imports, settings, entry points, and URL resolution.

Evidence: Implementation commit `5ef5d5c` on `pr/stewardship-spec`
(`feat: scaffold the stewardship application`). See
[development notes](../../development/stewardship.md) and
[`test_scaffold.py`](../../../tests/stewardship/test_scaffold.py).
Host validation on September 7, 2026: `python -m pytest` passed 356 tests;
the 30 Stewardship smoke tests passed with 92.24% scoped statement coverage
(`python -m pytest tests/stewardship --cov=parishkit.stewardship --cov-fail-under=80`).
Ruff check/format and Markdown checks passed. The production profile deliberately
rejects startup while ARC-02 is unimplemented; its complete deployment validation
is not claimed by this scaffold. Internal readiness and metrics remain closed;
ingress isolation and container verification belong to ARC-03/OPS-01 and M0.
