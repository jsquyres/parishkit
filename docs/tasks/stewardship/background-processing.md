# Background processing tasks

[Normative specification](../../specs/stewardship/background-processing/spec.md) · [Milestones](milestones.md)

Each task maps to the same numbered item in its linked work package. Read that
item in full: the short label below does not replace its requirements or tests.
Follow the [execution and completion rules](README.md#execution-and-completion).

## BG-01: Durable task, scheduler, lease, and recovery substrate

Scope and dependencies: [BG-01 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-01-durable-task-scheduler-lease-and-recovery-substrate).

- [ ] BG-01.01 — Implement task/occurrence transitions, claims, and retry chains.
- [ ] BG-01.02 — Configure singleton scheduling, lost-hint recovery, and isolated queues.
- [ ] BG-01.03 — Implement transactional campaign-work admission.
- [ ] BG-01.04 — Expose authorized task progress and status.
- [ ] BG-01.05 — Test all state transitions, admission guards, retries, crashes, and leases.

Evidence: In progress after DAT-03 storage. The
[Phase 2 checkpoints](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md) include internal
UUID-only hint dispatch, queue/type isolation, repeated owning admission,
explicit verified outcomes, abandoned-work fencing/recovery and bounded fair
lost-hint scanning. Nine PostgreSQL tests and sixteen pure input tests pass.
No item is complete yet: singleton runtime scheduling, Celery/Valkey transport,
concrete campaign/restore/purge admission, authorized progress endpoints and
their integration/fault tests remain. Source-specific handlers arrive with BG-05;
the generic dispatcher does not enable unimplemented provider operations.
