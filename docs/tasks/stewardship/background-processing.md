# Background processing tasks

[Task index](README.md) · [Implementation plan](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md) ·
[Normative specification](../../specs/stewardship/background-processing/spec.md) · [Milestones](milestones.md)

Each task maps to the same numbered item in its linked work package. Read that
item in full: the short label below does not replace its requirements or tests.
Follow the [execution and completion rules](README.md#execution-and-completion).

Phase 2 results at `ea2d5cb` below are pre-consolidation evidence, retained on
the named backup branch. Follow the
[consolidation record](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2-simplification.md) for
current baseline/review/CI acceptance; old counts do not certify the current tree.

## BG-01: Durable task, scheduler, lease, and recovery substrate

Scope and dependencies: [BG-01 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-01-durable-task-scheduler-lease-and-recovery-substrate).

- [x] BG-01.01 — Implement task/occurrence transitions, claims, and retry chains.
- [x] BG-01.02 — Configure singleton scheduling, lost-hint recovery, and isolated queues.
- [x] BG-01.03 — Implement transactional campaign-work admission.
- [x] BG-01.04 — Expose authorized task progress and status.
- [x] BG-01.05 — Test all state transitions, admission guards, retries, crashes, and leases.

Evidence: Implemented and accepted in Phase 2 at `ea2d5cb`: durable Task transitions,
UUID-only hint dispatch, singleton scheduling, finite lease renewal, queue/type
isolation, lost-hint recovery, source request bindings, compiled owning admission,
and Admin-only passive task/count/history pages. Actual worker, scheduler and
mail service startup uses isolated mounts, grants and Valkey credentials.
Tests cover state transitions, races, failed/drained work, restricted SQL roles
and real disposable-Valkey transport/controller behavior. The
[acceptance index](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2-acceptance.md) controls current
integrated validation and the required three full-phase review/fix rounds; all
pass. PR CI and human merge approval remain required. Earlier incremental counts
and implementation history are
retained only in the [checkpoint guide](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md).

## BG-02: Campaign boundary occurrences

Scope and dependencies: [BG-02 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-02-campaign-boundary-occurrences).

- [x] BG-02.01 — Materialize unique campaign boundary occurrences.
- [x] BG-02.02 — Implement locked start and close transitions.
- [ ] BG-02.03 — Replace future close work and implement shared restore/reopen token preparation.
- [x] BG-02.04 — Recover overdue boundaries in order while enforcing exact access gates.
- [x] BG-02.05 — Test DST, restart, duplicate, and boundary races.

Evidence: [Campaign-boundary increment](../../guides/stewardship-campaign-boundaries.md)
begins from verified PR #31 merge `f4e000c5`. BG-02.01/.02/.04/.05 now deliver
compiled scheduler/worker integration, restricted-role and timing/lag evidence,
DST/concurrent execution, and human-approved repeated-date execution revisions
with immutable replacement history. BG-02.03's end-date replacement is complete;
its shared restore/reopen token worker stays in Phase 6, so that task remains
unchecked. Three completed dual-source review/fix rounds, 102 boundary/schema
regressions, 5,540 baseline tests and operational Compose evidence are recorded
in the linked guide. All 24 final-head PR CI jobs and all 24 merge-group jobs
passed; PR #32 merged as `5c85d26f`, verified on refreshed `origin/main`.
These task completions do not release Gate 3 or enable later mail owners.

## BG-03: Production-transition cleanup worker

Scope and dependencies: [BG-03 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-03-production-transition-cleanup-worker).

- [x] BG-03.01 — Enforce the go-live gate and rehearsal invalidation.
- [x] BG-03.02 — Delete inventoried Testing and rehearsal credential detail in resumable batches.
- [x] BG-03.03 — Verify cleanup completeness before readiness.
- [x] BG-03.04 — Implement safe retry and cancellation semantics.
- [x] BG-03.05 — Test interrupted cleanup and concurrent Testing work.

Evidence: Implemented and locally accepted on `pr/stewardship-production-cleanup`,
based on PR #32 merge `5c85d26f`. The
[increment guide](../../guides/stewardship-production-cleanup.md) records all three
complete dual-source review/fix rounds, 100 passing cleanup tests, 93.57% line
and 81.15% branch coverage, schema/ownership/race/runtime validation and submitted-
Family scale measurements. Final-head PR and protected merge-group CI are still
required before delivery. This does not release Gate 3 or enable Production
activation; ADM-05 and its other dependencies retain those boundaries.

## BG-04: Schedule revision, fulfillment, and mode routing

Scope and dependencies: [BG-04 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-04-schedule-revision-fulfillment-and-mode-routing).

- [ ] BG-04.01 — Evaluate schedules using campaign-local intervals.
- [ ] BG-04.02 — Implement revision and semantic-fulfillment identity.
- [ ] BG-04.03 — Implement locked replacement, removal, and cancellation.
- [ ] BG-04.04 — Enforce immutable Testing/Production/operational routing.
- [ ] BG-04.05 — Implement missed-work coalescing and bounded asynchronous activation catch-up.
- [ ] BG-04.06 — Test schedule, mode, revision, and restart combinations.

Evidence: Not started.

## BG-05: ParishSoft delta and full refresh

Scope and dependencies: [BG-05 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-05-parishsoft-delta-and-full-refresh).

- [x] BG-05.01 — Implement supported change-feed and watermark adapters.
- [x] BG-05.02 — Implement delta indications and affected-Family reloads.
- [x] BG-05.03 — Implement scheduled and manual complete source refreshes.
- [x] BG-05.04 — Fence source mutations and validate promotion inputs.
- [x] BG-05.05 — Coalesce manual refresh and exclude concurrent publication.
- [x] BG-05.06 — Test invalid corpora, retries, takeover, and reconciliation.

Evidence: Implemented and accepted in Phase 2 at `ea2d5cb`: coherent bounded full and
Family-delta reads, exact source/Task/credential bindings, complete-corpus
validation, atomic promotion and Family/chair reconciliation, immutable
full-fallback dependencies, scheduled/manual request coalescing, and drained
recovery/cleanup. The compiled isolated runtime binds actual key inventories,
provider mounts and restricted database grants. Admin-managed Ministry activity
survives subsequent source refreshes. Shared client, pure normalization/cadence,
PostgreSQL ownership/race and operational Compose tests cover these paths.

The Admin-editable nightly time now has a versioned schema and integration
editor, with passing pure validation, Admin-to-scheduler, projection, credential
replay and offline-recovery regressions. Full integrated acceptance and the
required three complete-phase review/fix rounds pass. See the
[acceptance index](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2-acceptance.md) for current
validation and the [checkpoint guide](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md) for
chronological history. PR CI and human merge approval remain required.

## BG-06: Family invitations and reminders

- [ ] BG-06.03 — Render personalized templates with mode/epoch-scoped credentials.
- [ ] BG-06.04 — Seal substitutions for isolated mail dispatch.
- [ ] BG-06.05 — Implement provider outcomes, reconciliation, and scrubbing.
- [ ] BG-06.06 — Implement pause holds, close cancellation, and resume.
- [ ] BG-06.07 — Test recipients, suppression, routing, races, and failures.

Evidence: Not started.

## BG-07: Submission confirmations and Admin digests

Scope and dependencies: [BG-07 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-07-submission-confirmations-and-admin-digests).

- [ ] BG-07.04 — Integrate post-close obligation inventory and explicit resolutions.
- [ ] BG-07.05 — Test digest coverage, parity, recovery, and repeat safety.

- [ ] BG-09.03 — Implement grouped writes, bounded retries, and verification.
- [ ] BG-09.04 — Record partial outcomes and request final source refresh.
- [ ] BG-09.05 — Test external races, ambiguous writes, and partial recovery.

Evidence: Not started.

## BG-10: Critical notification and service shutdown

Scope and dependencies: [BG-10 work package](../../plans/stewardship/background-processing.md#bg-10-critical-notification-and-service-shutdown).
