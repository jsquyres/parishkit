Each task maps to the same numbered item in its linked work package. Read that

## ADM-01: Login, denial, and unconfigured-state routing

Scope and dependencies: [ADM-01 work package](../../plans/stewardship/admin-portal.md#adm-01-login-denial-and-unconfigured-state-routing).

- [x] ADM-01.01 — Build Google login, callback, logout, and denial pages.
- [x] ADM-01.02 — Gate all Admin routes on current authorization and state.
- [x] ADM-01.03 — Handle unconfigured and maintenance states.
- [x] ADM-01.04 — Audit login, logout, timeout, and revocation.
- [x] ADM-01.05 — Test direct routes and partial endpoints.

Evidence: Phase 1B implements Google-only initiation/callback, CSRF logout,
retryable denial, current-role checks and durable login/session audit. Real
PostgreSQL and synthetic signed Google tests cover normal and denied claims,
revocation, cookie isolation, expiry and recovery boundaries. Setup/maintenance
routing and direct HTML/POST admission pass ten additional PostgreSQL cases.
The actual wizard and its durable configured marker stay with ADM-02; absent
marker providers fail closed. See [Phase 1B evidence](../../guides/stewardship-phase-1b.md).

## ADM-02: Bootstrap command and transactional setup wizard

Scope and dependencies: [ADM-02 work package](../../plans/stewardship/admin-portal.md#adm-02-bootstrap-command-and-transactional-setup-wizard).

- [ ] ADM-02.01 — Implement bootstrap configuration and every required keyring.
- [ ] ADM-02.02 — Implement isolated temporary setup staging.
- [ ] ADM-02.03 — Implement heartbeat-aware setup progress and watchdog.
- [ ] ADM-02.04 — Expire aborted staging and reject late worker completion.
- [ ] ADM-02.05 — Finalize secrets, YAML, source, and campaign setup coherently.
- [ ] ADM-02.06 — Test wizard aborts, concurrency, and installer recovery.

Evidence: Bootstrap and independent keyring preparation are implemented and
covered by Phase 2 offline/database tests. Session-isolated wizard staging,
worker credential handoff and final configured-marker activation remain open.
See [Phase 2 evidence](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md).

## ADM-03: Navigation, dashboard, indicators, and configuration

Scope and dependencies: [ADM-03 work package](../../plans/stewardship/admin-portal.md#adm-03-navigation-dashboard-indicators-and-configuration).

- [ ] ADM-03.01 — Build role-filtered navigation and dashboard.
- [ ] ADM-03.02 — Build persistent operational-state banners.
- [ ] ADM-03.03 — Build presence and background-task indicators.
- [ ] ADM-03.04 — Build durable configuration, Ministry activity, and credential editors.
- [ ] ADM-03.05 — Keep Parish-timezone edits prospective.
- [ ] ADM-03.06 — Build branding previews and variant handling.
- [ ] ADM-03.07 — Test configuration UI, Ministry activity, concurrency, and timezone isolation.

Evidence: In progress. The Ministry activity and Parish profile editors use
signed exact previews and durable Applying/Applied configuration requests;
42 PostgreSQL cases cover required fields, source/configuration changes,
permissions, restricted web grants, installation, retry, and campaign-timezone
isolation. Navigation, Testing banners, passive Family-presence/background
indicators and HTML task history now pass PostgreSQL and three-engine browser
tests. Branding, integration replacement and the remaining full acceptance
checks are not complete. See
[Phase 2 evidence](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md#worker-composition-and-initial-admin-editors-in-progress).

## ADM-04: Campaign editor, content, schedules, and previews

Scope and dependencies: [ADM-04 work package](../../plans/stewardship/admin-portal.md#adm-04-campaign-editor-content-schedules-and-previews).

- [ ] ADM-04.01 — Build guarded campaign creation and cloning.
- [ ] ADM-04.02 — Build structural campaign configuration forms.
- [ ] ADM-04.03 — Build named content and email-template editors.
- [ ] ADM-04.04 — Build page previews and readiness-test emails.
- [ ] ADM-04.05 — Build atomic schedule reconciliation previews.
- [ ] ADM-04.06 — Test campaign editing, previews, and schedule races.

Evidence: In progress. New-draft creation and structural editing now use
actor/configuration/source/runtime-bound exact previews and Applied receipts.
The editor covers dates, timezone, modules, current Ministry/fund selections,
financial/comparison periods, additional information and structural read-only
states. Combined form/editor/navigation tests pass 85 cases with 98% focused
coverage; the expanded browser suite passes 135 cases across three engines.
Cloning, content/templates, schedule reconciliation and
readiness-test emails remain open. See [Phase 2 evidence](../../guides/stewardship-phase-2.md).

## ADM-05: Production transition and pre-start withdrawal

Scope and dependencies: [ADM-05 work package](../../plans/stewardship/admin-portal.md#adm-05-production-transition-and-pre-start-withdrawal).
