# Agent and Developer Instructions

`parishkit` contains reusable Python automation for Catholic parishes.

- Keep package code parish-neutral.
- Target Python 3.12 or newer.
- Store shared code under `src/parishkit`.
- Store executable wrappers under `scripts/<tool-name>/`.
- Do not commit credentials, secrets, local logs, caches, generated reports, or
  local runtime configuration.
- Put parish-specific mappings and operational settings in YAML configuration.
- Use shared CLI, logging, configuration, retry, and authentication helpers.
- New wrapper scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and have their
  executable bit set.
- Do not add ad hoc `sys.path` changes to import package code.
- Use `ruff` and `pytest` for local validation.
- Preserve existing tool behavior unless an intentional behavior change is
  requested or documented.
- Commits require a Developer Certificate of Origin `Signed-off-by:` trailer.
- There is no requirement for LLM attribution in commits.
- Use the Common Convention commit style.
- Prefer self-contained commits that keep the repository bisectable.
- Put drive-by fixes in their own commits.
- Squash fixup commits before pull requests are merged into target branches.
- Write commit messages that explain why the change exists, not only what
  changed.
- Wrap commit message body lines at approximately 75 characters.
- GitHub issue and pull request descriptions should use one line per paragraph
  and let GitHub render wrapping.
